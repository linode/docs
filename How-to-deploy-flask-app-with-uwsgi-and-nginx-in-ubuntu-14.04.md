<hr>

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2. This guide provides and introduction into deploying a Flask application using [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) on Ubuntu 14.04.


## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do **not** follow the Configure a Firewall section

3.  Update your system.

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

{:.note}
>
>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.


## Building Our Flask App

### Setting Up Our Environment

1. Lets install `pip` to be able to download install python package easily and install vim too. We also need to install `python-dev` because its needed by uwsgi when compiling:
	sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip vim

2. We are going to install `virtualenv` with pip and then create a virtual environment to hold our flask app
	sudo pip install virtualenv 
	mkdir flask_app
	virtualenv flask_app

3. Now `cd` into the flask_app directory and activate the virtual environment:
	cd flask_app
	source bin/activate
	
4. Now that the virtual environment is activated we will install `flask` and uwsgi:
	pip install flask
	pip install uwsgi

### Building Our App
1. Create a new directory name app and create a file called `app.py`:
	mkdir app
	cd app
	vim app.py

2. Now lets write the flask app:
	{:.file-excerpt}
	/flask_app/app/app.py
	:	~~~py
		from flask import Flask
		
		application = Flask(__name__)
		
		@application.route("/")
		def index():
			res = '''<h2>Hello<h2><br>
				I'm a flask app'''
			return res
		
		if __name__ == '__main__':
			application.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
		~~~

3. Now lets test our app if it working:
	python app.py

4. Open your browser and enter the ip address of your server followed by `:5000`. You should see the `Hello` message.

5. Close the flask app by type `CTRL-C`
### Create the UWSGI script
Since we will be using Nginx as our server to serve our app there are some configuration we will need to do. Nginx will
be serving a web app not a website, that is the content will be generated by our app not by static files(.html)

1. Create another file called wsgi.py in the app directory, this file is what we will use to bridge the connection between our web app and Nginx it acts as a gateway interface, WSGI stands for "Web Server Gateway Interface".:
	{:.file-excerpt}
	/flask_app/app/wsgi.py
	:	~~~ py
		from app import application

		if __name__ =='__main__':
			application.run()
		~~~
In the above script we imported our application instance from our app script. Always remember to name out application instance application, if it has another name it might not work with the wsgi.py script.

2. Test the wsgi.py file:
	uwsgi --socket '0.0.0.0:5000' --protocol=http -w wsgi.py

3. Open your browser and enter the ip address of your server followed by `:5000`

4. Now close the uwsgi instance by press `CTRL-C`

5. Deactivate the virtaul environment:
	deactivate


### Create an Upstart Script for the App
Now we are going to be creating a start script, This is the script that will be use to run our app. 
1. Create a uwsgi configuration script, name it `app.ini`:
	vim app.ini

2. Now write this in the script, we will be defining the protocol to use, which will be uwsgi its a binary protocol that Nginx speaks natively, that applications can use to talk to web server. We will create a one master module, then we will create 5 processes. The script will create a Unix socket that will be use as a pipe line between our app and Nginx.  :
	{:.file-excerpt}
	/flask_app/app/app.ini
	:	~~~ ini
		[uwsgi]
		module = wsgi

		master = true
		processes = 5
		
		socket = app.sock
		chmod-socket = 660
		vacuum = true

		die-on-term = true
		~~~
3. close it and save it.

4. Create another script but this time in the `/etc/init` folder. This will be our upstart script This is the upstart script that will actually start up our `app.ini`, In this script we are going to define the start and stop level of our app, and also to set up the user who should run our app. The `user` should be replaced with the USER that is set up on the server. We neec to start our virtual environment with the by setting up `env`, then we change our directory into our app directory before executing our start script.:
	vim /etc/init/app.conf

5. Write into it:
	{:.file-excerpt}
	/etc/init/app.conf
	:	~~~ conf
		description "uWSGI server instance to serve the flask app"
		
		start on runlevel [2345]
		stop on runlevel [!2345]

		setuid `user`
		setgid www-data

		env PATH=/home/`user`/flask_app/bin/
		chdir /home/`user`/flask_app/app/
		exec uwsgi --ini app.ini
		~~~
6. Save the file. That's all the configuration for the flask app. Now lets move on the Nginx

## Installing and Configuring Nginx

### Install Nginx

1. Start by installing Nginx:
	sudo apt-get install nginx nginx-common

2. When the installation is done. Open a browser and enter your server ip address. You will be greeted by the Nginx welcome page

### Configuring Nginx to server our flask app.
Nginx will be serve our web app so there are some configuration we need to do first. We will need to create a file that Nginx will use to so know where to look for our app and how to serve the app.
1. Create a file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` name the file `app`:
	sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/app

2. Here we are going create a server block in our app file, this server block will tell Nginx which port to listen to for our web app, and also the `ip address` or `domain name`. Since we are serving a web app we need to add the location of our unix socket created by our start script.  .Write into it:
	{:.file-excerpt}
	/etc/nginx/sites-available/app
	:	~~~
		server {
			listen 80;
			server_name `your_server_ip_address`;
			
			location / {
					include uwsgi_params;
					uwsgi_pass unix:/home/`user`/flask_app/app/app.sock;
				   }
			}
		~~~
3. Now close the file and then create a synlink to nginx's `/etc/ngnix/sites-enabled`. A synlink should be created in the `sites-enabled` folder so that Nginx will know to server our app.  
	sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

4. Start the app uwsgi instance:
	sudo start app

5. Restart Nginx:
	sudo service nginx restart
