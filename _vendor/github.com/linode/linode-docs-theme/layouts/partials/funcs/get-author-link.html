{{/* Due to legacy, we have front matter values for both author and contributor.

  The rules are:
  
  1. Use the author name, if present. However, if the author's name contains Linode, then check to see if a contributor name is set, and use that instead if it is present.
  2. If contributor link is present, set that as a link in the title byline. All links have been set to be HTTPS URLs, so we don't have to try and parse Twitter/Linkedin/etc @usernames.
