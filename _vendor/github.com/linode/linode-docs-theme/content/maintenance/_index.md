## Tips for Maintainers

Note that the edit links above will point locally when running the Hugo server. Also, there may be cache issues when you're in the process of fixing these links, so a practical work flow may be:

* Run with `hugo server --navigateToChanged`.
* Click on either the `Edit Source` or `Edit Target` link.
* Make your changes and save.
* Make a cosmetic change to this page (`content/maintenance/_index.md`) to force a rebuild and navigation back to this page.
* Note that some changes will currently need a full rebuild to take effect.

Also note that the above list is also available as a JSON file at [/docs/maintenance/index.json](/docs/maintenance/index.json).
