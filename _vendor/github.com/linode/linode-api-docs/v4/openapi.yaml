  title: Linode API
  description: |
    ## Introduction
    The Linode API provides the ability to programmatically manage the full
    range of Linode products and services.

    This reference is designed to assist application developers and system
    administrators.  Each endpoint includes descriptions, request syntax, and
    examples using standard HTTP requests. Response data is returned in JSON
    format.


    This document was generated from our OpenAPI Specification.  See the
    <a target="_top" href="https://www.openapis.org">OpenAPI website</a> for more information.

    ## Access and Authentication

    Some endpoints are publicly accessible without requiring authentication.
    All endpoints affecting your Account, however, require either a Personal
    Access Token or OAuth authentication (when using third-party
    applications).

    ### Personal Access Token

    The easiest way to access the API is with a Personal Access Token (PAT)
    generated from the
    <a target="_top" href="https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens">Linode Cloud Manager</a> or
    the [Create Personal Access Token](/docs/api/profile/#personal-access-token-create) endpoint.

    All scopes for the OAuth security model ([defined below](/docs/api/#oauth)) apply to this
    security model as well.

    ### Authentication

    | Security Scheme Type: | HTTP |
    |-----------------------|------|
    | **HTTP Authorization Scheme** | bearer |

    ## OAuth

    If you only need to access the Linode API for personal use,
    we recommend that you create a [personal access token](/docs/api/#personal-access-token).
    If you're designing an application that can authenticate with an arbitrary Linode user, then
    you should use the OAuth 2.0 workflows presented in this section.

    For a more detailed example of an OAuth 2.0 implementation, see our guide on [How to Create an OAuth App with the Linode Python API Library](/docs/products/tools/api/guides/create-an-oauth-app-with-the-python-api-library/#oauth-2-authentication-exchange).

    Before you implement OAuth in your application, you first need to create an OAuth client. You can do this [with the Linode API](/docs/api/account/#oauth-client-create) or [via the Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/clients):

      - When creating the client, you'll supply a `label` and a `redirect_uri` (referred to as the Callback URL in the Cloud Manager).
      - The response from this endpoint will give you a `client_id` and a `secret`.
      - Clients can be public or private, and are private by default. You can choose to make the client public when it is created.
        - A private client is used with applications which can securely store the client secret (that is, the secret returned to you when you first created the client). For example, an application running on a secured server that only the developer has access to would use a private OAuth client. This is also called a confidential client in some OAuth documentation.
        - A public client is used with applications where the client secret is not guaranteed to be secure. For example, a native app running on a user's computer may not be able to keep the client secret safe, as a user could potentially inspect the source of the application. So, native apps or apps that run in a user's browser should use a public client.
        - Public and private clients follow different workflows, as described below.

    ### OAuth Workflow

    The OAuth workflow is a series of exchanges between your third-party app and Linode. The workflow is used
    to authenticate a user before an application can start making API calls on the user's behalf.

    Notes:

    - With respect to the diagram in [section 1.2 of RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.2), login.linode.com (referred to in this section as the *login server*)
    is the Resource Owner and the Authorization Server; api.linode.com (referred to here as the *api server*) is the Resource Server.
    - The OAuth spec refers to the private and public workflows listed below as the [authorization code flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) and [implicit flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2).

    | PRIVATE WORKFLOW | PUBLIC WORKFLOW |
    |------------------|------------------|
    | 1.  The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. | 1.  The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. |
    | 2.  Your application then redirects the user to Linode's [login server](https://login.linode.com) with the client application's `client_id` and requested OAuth `scope`, which should appear in the URL of the login page. | 2.  Your application then redirects the user to Linode's [login server](https://login.linode.com) with the client application's `client_id` and requested OAuth `scope`, which should appear in the URL of the login page. |
    | 3.  The user logs into the login server with their username and password. | 3.  The user logs into the login server with their username and password. |
    | 4.  The login server redirects the user to the specificed redirect URL with a temporary authorization `code` (exchange code) in the URL. | 4.  The login server redirects the user back to your application with an OAuth `access_token` embedded in the redirect URL's hash. This is temporary and expires in two hours. No `refresh_token` is issued. Therefore, once the `access_token` expires, a new one will need to be issued by having the user log in again. |
    | 5.  The application issues a POST request (*see additional details below*) to the login server with the exchange code, `client_id`, and the client application's `client_secret`. | |
    | 6.  The login server responds to the client application with a new OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token`. The `access_token` is set to expire in two hours. | |
    | 7.  The `refresh_token` can be used by contacting the login server with the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `grant_type`, and `refresh_token` to get a new OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token`. The new `access_token` is good for another two hours, and the new `refresh_token` can be used to extend the session again by this same method (*see additional details below*). | |

    #### OAuth Private Workflow - Additional Details

    The following information expands on steps 5 through 7 of the private workflow:

    Once the user has logged into Linode and you have received an exchange code,
    you will need to trade that exchange code for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`. You
    do this by making an HTTP POST request to the following address:

    ```
    https://login.linode.com/oauth/token
    ```

    Make this request as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or as
    `multipart/form-data` and include the following parameters in the POST body:

    | PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | client_id | Your app's client ID. |
    | client_secret | Your app's client secret. |
    | code | The code you just received from the redirect. |

    You'll get a response like this:

    ```json
    {
      "scope": "linodes:read_write",
      "access_token": "03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c",
      "refresh_token": "f2ec9712e616fdb5a2a21aa0e88cfadea7502ebc62cf5bd758dbcd65e1803bad",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "expires_in": 7200
    }
    ```

    Included in the response is an `access_token`. With this token, you can proceed to make
    authenticated HTTP requests to the API by adding this header to each request:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer 03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c
    ```

    This `access_token` is set to expire in two hours. To refresh access prior to expiration, make another request to the same URL with the following parameters in the POST body:

    | PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | grant_type | The grant type you're using. Use "refresh_token" when refreshing access. |
    | client_id | Your app's client ID. |
    | client_secret | Your app's client secret. |
    | refresh_token | The `refresh_token` received from the previous response. |

    You'll get another response with an updated `access_token` and `refresh_token`, which can then be used to refresh access again.

    ## Requests

    Requests must be made over HTTPS to ensure transactions are encrypted. Data included in requests must be supplied in json format unless otherwise specified in the command description.

    The following request methods are supported:

    | METHOD  | USAGE |
    |---------|-------|
    | GET     | Retrieves data about collections and individual resources. |
    | POST    | For collections, creates a new resource of that type. Also used to perform actions on action endpoints. |
    | PUT     | Updates an existing resource. |
    | DELETE  | Deletes a resource. This is a destructive action. |
    | HEAD    | Returns only the response header information of a GET request |
    | OPTIONS | Provides permitted communication options for a command |

    ## Responses

    ### Response Status Codes

    Actions will return one of the following HTTP response status codes:

    | STATUS  | DESCRIPTION |
    |---------|-------------|
    | 200 OK  | The request was successful. |
    | 202 Accepted | The request was successful, but processing has not been completed. The response body includes a "warnings" array containing the details of incomplete processes. |
    | 204 No Content | The server successfully fulfilled the request and there is no additional content to send. |

    ### Response Headers

    There are many ways to access response header information for individual command URLs, depending on how you are accessing the Linode API. For example, to view HTTP response headers for the `/regions` endpoint when making requests with `curl`, use the `-I` or `--head` option as follows:

    ```Shell
    curl -I https://api.linode.com/v4/regions
    ```

    Responses may include the following headers:

    | HEADER | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE |
    |--------|-------------|---------|
    | Access-Control-Allow-Credentials | Responses to credentialed requests are exposed to frontend JavaScript code. | true |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Headers | All permissible request headers for this endpoint. | Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, X-Filter |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Methods | Permissible HTTP methods for this endpoint | HEAD, GET, OPTIONS, POST, PUT, DELETE |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Origin | Indicates origin access permissions. The wildcard character `*` means any origin can access the resource. | * |
    | Access-Control-Expose-Headers | Available headers to include in response to cross-origin requests. | X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Status |
    | Cache-Control | Controls caching in browsers and shared caches such as CDNs. | private, max-age=60, s-maxage=60 |
    | Content-Security-Policy | Controls which resources are allowed to load. By default, resources do not load. | default-src 'none' |
    | Content-Type | All responses are in json format. | application/json |

    ## Errors

    Success is indicated via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="_top">Standard HTTP status codes</a>.
    `2xx` codes indicate success, `4xx` codes indicate a request error, and
    `5xx` errors indicate a server error. A
    request error might be an invalid input, a required parameter being omitted,
    or a malformed request. A server error means something went wrong processing
    your request. If this occurs, please
    [open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)
    and let us know. Though errors are logged and we work quickly to resolve issues,
    opening a ticket and providing us with reproducable steps and data is always helpful.

    The `errors` field is an array of the things that went wrong with your request.
    We will try to include as many of the problems in the response as possible,
    but it's conceivable that fixing these errors and resubmitting may result in
    new errors coming back once we are able to get further along in the process
    of handling your request.

    Within each error object, the `field` parameter will be included if the error
    pertains to a specific field in the JSON you've submitted. This will be
    omitted if there is no relevant field. The `reason` is a human-readable
    explanation of the error, and will always be included.

    ## Pagination

    Resource lists are always paginated. The response will look similar to this:

    ```json
    {
        "data": [ ... ],
        "page": 1,
        "pages": 3,
        "results": 300
    }
    ```

    * Pages start at 1. You may retrieve a specific page of results by adding
    `?page=x` to your URL (for example, `?page=4`). If the value of `page`
    exceeds `2^64/page_size`, the last possible page will be returned.


    * Page sizes default to 100,
    and can be set to return between 25 and 500. Page size can be set using
    `?page_size=x`.

    ## Filtering and Sorting

    Collections are searchable by fields they include, marked in the spec as
    `x-linode-filterable: true`. Filters are passed
    in the `X-Filter` header and are formatted as JSON objects. Here is a request
    call for Linode Types in our "standard" class:

    ```Shell
    curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
      -H 'X-Filter: { "class": "standard" }'
    ```

    The filter object's keys are the keys of the object you're filtering,
    and the values are accepted values. You can add multiple filters by
    including more than one key. For example, filtering for "standard" Linode
    Types that offer one vcpu:

    ```Shell
     curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
      -H 'X-Filter: { "class": "standard", "vcpus": 1 }'
    ```

    In the above example, both filters are combined with an "and" operation.
    However, if you wanted either Types with one vcpu or Types in our "standard"
    class, you can add an operator:

     ```Shell
    curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
      -H 'X-Filter: { "+or": [ { "vcpus": 1 }, { "class": "standard" } ] }'
    ```

    Each filter in the `+or` array is its own filter object, and all conditions
    in it are combined with an "and" operation as they were in the previous example.

    Other operators are also available. Operators are keys of a Filter JSON
    object. Their value must be of the appropriate type, and they are evaluated
    as described below:

    | OPERATOR | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                       |
    |----------|--------|-----------------------------------|
    | +and     | array  | All conditions must be true.       |
    | +or      | array  | One condition must be true.        |
    | +gt      | number | Value must be greater than number. |
    | +gte     | number | Value must be greater than or equal to number. |
    | +lt      | number | Value must be less than number. |
    | +lte     | number | Value must be less than or equal to number. |
    | +contains | string | Given string must be in the value. |
    | +neq      | string | Does not equal the value.          |
    | +order_by | string | Attribute to order the results by - must be filterable. |
    | +order    | string | Either "asc" or "desc". Defaults to "asc". Requires `+order_by`. |

    For example, filtering for [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/)
    that offer memory equal to or higher than 61440:

    ```Shell
    curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
      -H '
        X-Filter: {
          "memory": {
            "+gte": 61440
          }
        }'
    ```

    You can combine and nest operators to construct arbitrarily-complex queries.
    For example, give me all [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/)
    which are either `standard` or `highmem` class, or
    have between 12 and 20 vcpus:

    ```Shell
    curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
      -H '
        X-Filter: {
          "+or": [
            {
              "+or": [
                {
                  "class": "standard"
                },
                {
                  "class": "highmem"
                }
              ]
            },
            {
              "+and": [
                {
                  "vcpus": {
                    "+gte": 12
                  }
                },
                {
                  "vcpus": {
                    "+lte": 20
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }'
    ```
    ## Time Values

    All times returned by the API are in UTC, regardless of the timezone configured within your user's profile (see `timezone` property within [Profile View](/docs/api/profile/#profile-view__responses)).

    ## Rate Limiting

    Rate limits on API requests help maintain the health and stability of the Linode API. Accordingly, every endpoint of the Linode API applies a rate limit on a per user basis as determined by OAuth token for authenticated requests or IP address for public endpoints.

    Each rate limit consists of a total number of requests and a time window. For example, if an endpoint has a rate limit of 800 requests per minute, then up to 800 requests over a one minute window are permitted. Subsequent requests to an endpoint after hitting a rate limit return a 429 error. You can successfully remake requests to that endpoint after the rate limit window resets.

    ### Linode APIv4 Rate Limits

    With the Linode API, you can generally make up to 1,600 general API requests every two minutes. Additionally, all endpoints have a rate limit of 800 requests per minute unless otherwise specified below.

    **Note:** There may be rate limiting applied at other levels outside of the API, for example, at the load balancer.

    Creating Linodes has a dedicated rate limit of 10 requests per 30 seconds. That endpoint is:

    * [Linode Create](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create)

    `/stats` endpoints have their own dedicated rate limits of 100 requests per minute. These endpoints are:

    * [View Linode Statistics](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-statistics-view)
    * [View Linode Statistics (year/month)](/docs/api/linode-instances/#statistics-yearmonth-view)
    * [View NodeBalancer Statistics](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#nodebalancer-statistics-view)
    * [List Managed Stats](/docs/api/managed/#managed-stats-list)

    Object Storage endpoints have a dedicated rate limit of 750 requests per second. The Object Storage endpoints are:

    * [Object Storage Endpoints](/docs/api/object-storage/)

    Opening Support Tickets has a dedicated rate limit of 2 requests per minute. That endpoint is:

    * [Open Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)

    Accepting Service Transfers has a dedicated rate limit of 2 requests per minute. That endpoint is:

    * [Service Transfer Accept](/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-accept)

    ### Rate Limit HTTP Response Headers

    The Linode API includes the following HTTP response headers which are designed to help you avoid hitting rate limits which might disrupt your applications:

    * **X-RateLimit-Limit**: The maximum number of permitted requests during the rate limit window for this endpoint.
    * **X-RateLimit-Remaining**: The remaining number of permitted requests in the current rate limit window.
    * **X-RateLimit-Reset**: The time when the current rate limit window rests in UTC epoch seconds.
    * **Retry-After**: The remaining time in seconds until the current rate limit window resets.

    ## CLI (Command Line Interface)

    The <a href="https://github.com/linode/linode-cli" target="_top">Linode CLI</a> allows you to easily
    work with the API using intuitive and simple syntax. It requires a
    [Personal Access Token](/docs/api/#personal-access-token)
    for authentication, and gives you access to all of the features and functionality
    of the Linode API that are documented here with CLI examples.

    Endpoints that do not have CLI examples are currently unavailable through the CLI, but
    can be accessed via other methods such as Shell commands and other third-party applications.

        Creates a transfer request for the specified services. A request can contain any of the specified service types
        and any number of each service type. At this time, only Linodes can be transferred.

        When created successfully, a confirmation email is sent to the account that created this transfer containing a
        transfer token and instructions on completing the transfer.

        When a transfer is [accepted](/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-accept), the requested services are moved to
        the receiving account. Linode services will not experience interruptions due to the transfer process. Backups
        for Linodes are transferred as well.

        DNS records that are associated with requested services will not be transferred or updated. Please ensure that
        associated DNS records have been updated or communicated to the recipient prior to the transfer.

        A transfer can take up to three hours to complete once accepted. When a transfer is
        completed, billing for transferred services ends for the sending account and begins for the receiving account.

        This command can only be accessed by the unrestricted users of an account.

        There are several conditions that must be met in order to successfully create a transfer request:

      description: |
        Accept a Service Transfer for the provided token to receive the services included in the transfer to your
        account. At this time, only Linodes can be transferred.

        When accepted, email confirmations are sent to the accounts that created and accepted the transfer. A transfer
        can take up to three hours to complete once accepted. Once a transfer is completed, billing for transferred
        services ends for the sending account and begins for the receiving account.

        This command can only be accessed by the unrestricted users of the account that receives the transfer. Users
        of the same account that created a transfer cannot accept the transfer.

        There are several conditions that must be met in order to accept a transfer request:

        1. Only transfers with a `pending` status can be accepted.

        1. The account accepting the transfer must have a registered payment method and must not have a past due
          balance or other account limitations for the services to be transferred.

        1. Both the account that created the transfer and the account that is accepting the transfer must not have any
        active Terms of Service violations.

        1. The service must still be owned by the account that created the transfer.

        1. Linodes must not:

            * be assigned to a NodeBalancer, Firewall, VLAN, or Managed Service.

            * have any attached Block Storage Volumes.

            * have any shared IP addresses.

            * have any assigned /56, /64, or /116 IPv6 ranges.

        Any and all of the above conditions must be cured and maintained by the relevant account prior to the
        transfer's expiration to allow the transfer to be accepted by the receiving account.

    #     New instances can take approximately 15 to 30 minutes to provision.

    #     The `allow_list` is used to control access to the Managed Database.

    #     * IP addresses and ranges in this list can access the Managed Database. All other sources are blocked.

    #     * If `0.0.0.0/0` is a value in this list, then all IP addresses can access the Managed Database.

    #     * Entering an empty array (`[]`) blocks all connections (both public and private) to the Managed Database.

    #     All Managed Databases include automatic, daily backups. Up to seven backups are automatically stored for each Managed Database, providing restore points for each day of the past week.

    #     All Managed Databases include automatic patch updates, which apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed MongoDB Database during configurable maintenance windows.

    #     * If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance window when any updates occur. It's recommended that you adjust this window to match a time that will be the least disruptive for your application and users. You may also want to consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.

    #     * **The database software is not updated automatically.** To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version. You can then migrate your databases from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.

    #     * To modify update the maintenance window for a Database, use the **Managed MongoDB Database Update** ([PUT /databases/mongodb/instances/{instanceId}](/docs/api/databases/#managed-mongodb-database-update)) command.

    #     **Note**: Managed MongoDB clusters are currently accessible over public IP addresses. To provide an additional layer of protection, support for private IP addresses is in development.

        Requires `read_write` access to the Database.

        The Database must have an `active` status to perform this command.

        Updating addresses in the `allow_list` overwrites any existing addresses.

        * IP addresses and ranges on this list can access the Managed Database. All other sources are blocked.

        * If `0.0.0.0/0` is a value in this list, then all IP addresses can access the Managed Database.

        * Entering an empty array (`[]`) blocks all connections (both public and private) to the Managed Database.

        * **Note**: Updates to the `allow_list` may take a short period of time to complete, making this command inappropriate for rapid successive updates to this property.

        All Managed Databases include automatic patch updates, which apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed MongoDB Database. The maintenance window for these updates is configured with the Managed Database's `updates` property.

        * If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance window when any updates occur. It's recommended that you adjust this window to match a time that will be the least disruptive for your application and users. You may also want to consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.

        * **The database software is not updated automatically.** To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version. You can then migrate your databases from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.

        Restore a backup to a Managed MongoDB Database on your Account.

        Requires `read_write` access to the Database.

        The Database must have an `active` status to perform this command.

        **Note**: Restoring from a backup will erase all existing data on the database instance and replace it with backup data.

        **Note**: Currently, restoring a backup after resetting Managed Database credentials results in a failed cluster. Please contact Customer Support if this occurs.

        **Note**: New MongoDB Databases cannot currently be created.

        Provision a Managed MySQL Database.

        Restricted Users must have the `add_databases` grant to use this command.

        New instances can take approximately 15 to 30 minutes to provision.

        The `allow_list` is used to control access to the Managed Database.

        * IP addresses and ranges in this list can access the Managed Database. All other sources are blocked.

        * If `0.0.0.0/0` is a value in this list, then all IP addresses can access the Managed Database.

        * Entering an empty array (`[]`) blocks all connections (both public and private) to the Managed Database.

        All Managed Databases include automatic, daily backups. Up to seven backups are automatically stored for each Managed Database, providing restore points for each day of the past week.

        All Managed Databases include automatic patch updates, which apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed MySQL Database during configurable maintenance windows.

        * If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance window when any updates occur. It's recommended that you adjust this window to match a time that will be the least disruptive for your application and users. You may also want to consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.

        * **The database software is not updated automatically.** To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version. You can then [migrate your databases](/docs/products/databases/managed-databases/guides/migrate-mysql/) from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.

        * To modify update the maintenance window for a Database, use the **Managed MySQL Database Update** ([PUT /databases/mysql/instances/{instanceId}](/docs/api/databases/#managed-mysql-database-update)) command.

        Updating addresses in the `allow_list` overwrites any existing addresses.

        * Entering an empty array (`[]`) blocks all connections (both public and private) to the Managed Database.

        * **Note**: Updates to the `allow_list` may take a short period of time to complete, making this command inappropriate for rapid successive updates to this property.

        All Managed Databases include automatic patch updates, which apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed MySQL Database. The maintenance window for these updates is configured with the Managed Database's `updates` property.

        * If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance window when any updates occur. It's recommended that you adjust this window to match a time that will be the least disruptive for your application and users. You may also want to consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.

You can then [migrate your databases](/docs/products/databases/managed-databases/guides/migrate-mysql/) from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.

        Provision a Managed PostgreSQL Database.

        Restricted Users must have the `add_databases` grant to use this command.

        New instances can take approximately 15 to 30 minutes to provision.

        The `allow_list` is used to control access to the Managed Database.

        * IP addresses and ranges in this list can access the Managed Database. All other sources are blocked.

        * If `0.0.0.0/0` is a value in this list, then all IP addresses can access the Managed Database.

        * Entering an empty array (`[]`) blocks all connections (both public and private) to the Managed Database.

        All Managed Databases include automatic, daily backups. Up to seven backups are automatically stored for each Managed Database, providing restore points for each day of the past week.

        All Managed Databases include automatic patch updates, which apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed PostgreSQL Database during configurable maintenance windows.

        * If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance window when any updates occur. It's recommended that you adjust this window to match a time that will be the least disruptive for your application and users. You may also want to consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.

        * **The database software is not updated automatically.** To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version. You can then migrate your databases from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.

        * To modify update the maintenance window for a Database, use the **Managed PostgreSQL Database Update** ([PUT /databases/postgresql/instances/{instanceId}](/docs/api/databases/#managed-postgresql-database-update)) command.

        Requires `read_write` access to the Database.

        The Database must have an `active` status to perform this command.

        **Note**

        * If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance. Consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.

        * **The database software is not updated automatically.** To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version. You can then migrate your databases from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.

      summary: Image Upload
      description: |
        Initiates an Image upload.

        This endpoint creates a new private Image object and returns it along
        with the URL to which image data can be uploaded.

        - Image data must be uploaded within 24 hours of creation or the
        upload will be cancelled and the image deleted.

        - Image uploads should be made as an HTTP PUT request to the URL returned in the `upload_to`
        response parameter, with a `Content-type: application/octet-stream` header included in the
        request. For example:

              curl -v \
                -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
                --upload-file example.img.gz \
                $UPLOAD_URL \
                --progress-bar \
                --output /dev/null

        - Uploaded image data should be compressed in gzip (`.gz`) format. The uncompressed disk should be in raw
        disk image (`.img`) format. A maximum compressed file size of 5GB is supported for upload at this time.

        **Note:** To initiate and complete an Image upload in a single step, see our guide on how to [Upload an Image](/docs/products/tools/images/guides/upload-an-image/) using Cloud Manager or the Linode CLI `image-upload` plugin.

      summary: Linode Create
      description: |
        Creates a Linode Instance on your Account. In order for this
        request to complete successfully, your User must have the `add_linodes` grant. Creating a
        new Linode will incur a charge on your Account.

        Linodes can be created using one of the available Types. See
        Types List ([GET /linode/types](/docs/api/linode-types/#types-list)) to get more
        information about each Type's specs and cost.

        Linodes can be created in any one of our available Regions, which are accessible from the
        Regions List ([GET /regions](/docs/api/regions/#regions-list)) endpoint.

        In an effort to fight spam, Linode restricts outbound connections on ports 25, 465, and 587
        on all Linodes for new accounts created after November 5th, 2019. For more information,
        see [Sending Email on Linode](/docs/guides/running-a-mail-server/#sending-email-on-linode).

        Linodes can be created in a number of ways:

        * Using a Linode Public Image distribution or a Private Image you created based on another Linode.
          * Access the Images List ([GET /images](/docs/api/images/#images-list)) endpoint with authentication to view
            all available Images.
          * The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.
          * A default config with two Disks, one being a 512 swap disk, is created.
            * `swap_size` can be used to customize the swap disk size.
          * Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.
          * It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.
          * You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.
            * These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first. See SSH Key Add ([POST /profile/sshkeys](/docs/api/profile/#ssh-key-add)) for more information.

        * Using a StackScript.
          * See StackScripts List ([GET /linode/stackscripts](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscripts-list)) for
            a list of available StackScripts.
          * The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.
          * Requires a compatible Image to be supplied.
            * See StackScript View ([GET /linode/stackscript/{stackscriptId}](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscript-view)) for compatible Images.
          * Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.
          * It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.
          * You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.
            * These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first. See SSH Key Add ([POST /profile/sshkeys](/docs/api/profile/#ssh-key-add)) for more information.

        * Using one of your other Linode's backups.
          * You must create a Linode large enough to accommodate the Backup's size.
          * The Disks and Config will match that of the Linode that was backed up.
          * The `root_pass` will match that of the Linode that was backed up.

        * Attached to a private VLAN.
          * Review the `interfaces` property of the [Request Body Schema](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create__request-body-schema) for details.
          * For more information, see our guide on [Getting Started with VLANs](/docs/products/networking/vlans/get-started/).

        * Create an empty Linode.
          * The Linode will remain `offline` and must be manually started.
            * See Linode Boot ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/boot](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-boot)).
          * Disks and Configs must be created manually.
          * This is only recommended for advanced use cases.

        **Important**: You must be an unrestricted User in order to add or modify
        tags on Linodes.

                        `successful`, and the Linode must be deployed to the same `region` as the Backup.
                        See [GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backups-list)

                        enrolled in the Linode Backup service. This will incur an additional charge.
                        The cost for the Backup service is dependent on the Type of Linode deployed.

                        This option is always treated as `true` if the account-wide `backups_enabled`
                        setting is `true`.  See [account settings](/docs/api/account/#account-settings-view)

        Deletes a Linode you have permission to `read_write`.

        **Deleting a Linode is a destructive action and cannot be undone.**

        Additionally, deleting a Linode:

          * Gives up any IP addresses the Linode was assigned.
          * Deletes all Disks, Backups, Configs, etc.
          * Stops billing for the Linode and its associated services. You will be billed for time used
            within the billing period the Linode was active.

        Linodes that are in the process of [cloning](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-clone) or [backup restoration](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backup-restore) cannot be deleted.

        queued must be completed first before you can clone to it.

        Up to five clone operations from any given source Linode can be run concurrently.
        If more concurrent clones are attempted, an HTTP 400 error will be
        returned by this endpoint.

        Any [tags](/docs/api/tags/#tags-list) existing on the source Linode will be cloned to the target Linode.

      description: |
        Adds a new Disk to a Linode.

        * You can optionally create a Disk from an Image or an Empty Disk if no Image is provided with a request.

        * When creating an Empty Disk, providing a `label` is required.

        * If no `label` is provided, an `image` is required instead.

        * When creating a Disk from an Image, `root_pass` is required.

        * The default filesystem for new Disks is `ext4`. If creating a Disk from an Image, the filesystem
        of the Image is used unless otherwise specified.

        * When deploying a StackScript on a Disk:
          * See StackScripts List ([GET /linode/stackscripts](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscripts-list)) for
            a list of available StackScripts.
          * Requires a compatible Image to be supplied.
            * See StackScript View ([GET /linode/stackscript/{stackscriptId}](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscript-view)) for compatible Images.
          * It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.
          * You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.
            * These users must have an SSH Key associated with their Profiles first. See SSH Key Add ([POST /profile/sshkeys](/docs/api/profile/#ssh-key-add)) for more information.

        if any, can be accessed from [GET /account/notifications](/docs/api/account/#notifications-list).
        When the migration begins, your Linode will be shutdown if not already off.
        If the migration initiated the shutdown, it will reboot the Linode when completed.


        To initiate a cross DC migration, you must pass a `region` parameter to the
        request body specifying the target data center region.
        You can view a list of all available regions and their feature capabilities
        from [GET /regions](/docs/api/regions/#regions-list). If your Linode has a DC migration already queued
        or you have initiated a previously scheduled migration, you will not be able to initiate
        a DC migration until it has completed.


        **Note:** Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers do not support IPv6 `/116` pools or IP Failover.
        If you have these features enabled on your Linode and attempt to migrate to an NGN data center,
        the migration will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility,
        you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

                    A cross data center migration will cancel a pending migration
                    that has not yet been initiated.

                    A cross data center migration will initiate a `linode_migrate_datacenter_create` event.

                    generation of hardware that corresponds to your Linode's Type, if

          * The Linode must not have a pending migration.
          * Your Account cannot have an outstanding balance.
          * The Linode must not have more disk allocation than the new Type allows.
            * In that situation, you must first delete or resize the disk to be smaller.

                      latest available patch for the Cluster's Kubernetes version.


                      When upgrading the Kubernetes version, only the next latest minor version following the current
                      version can be deployed. For example, a cluster with Kubernetes version 1.19 can be upgraded to
                      version 1.20, but not directly to 1.21.


                      The Kubernetes version of a cluster can not be downgraded.

                      Enabling High Availability for LKE is an **irreversible** change.

                      When upgrading pre-existing LKE clusters to use the HA Control Plane, the following changes will additionally occur:

                      - All nodes will be deleted and new nodes will be created to replace them.

                      - Any local storage (such as `hostPath` volumes) will be erased.

                      - The upgrade process may take several minutes to complete, as nodes will be replaced on a rolling basis.

      description: |
        Regenerate the Kubeconfig file and/or the service account token for a Cluster.

        This is a helper command that allows performing both the [Kubeconfig Delete](#kubeconfig-delete) and the [Service Token Delete](#service-token-delete) actions with a single request.

        When using this command, at least one of `kubeconfig` or `servicetoken` is required.

        **Note**: When regenerating a service account token, the Cluster's control plane components and Linode CSI drivers are also restarted and configured with the new token. High Availability Clusters should not experience any disruption, while standard Clusters may experience brief control plane downtime while components are restarted.

      description: |
        Delete and regenerate the service account token for a Cluster.

        **Note**: When regenerating a service account token, the Cluster's control plane components and Linode CSI drivers are also restarted and configured with the new token. High Availability Clusters should not experience any disruption, while standard Clusters may experience brief control plane downtime while components are restarted.

      summary: IP Addresses Assign
      description: |
        Assign multiple IPv4 addresses and/or IPv6 ranges to multiple Linodes in one Region. This allows swapping, shuffling, or otherwise reorganizing IPs to your Linodes.

        The following restrictions apply:
        * All Linodes involved must have at least one public IPv4 address after assignment.
        * Linodes may have no more than one assigned private IPv4 address.
        * Linodes may have no more than one assigned IPv6 range.

        [Open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open) to request additional IPv4 addresses or IPv6 ranges beyond standard account limits.

        **Note**: Removing an IP address that has been set as a Managed Linode's `ssh.ip` causes the Managed Linode's SSH access settings to reset to their default values. To view and configure Managed Linode SSH settings, use the following commands:
        * **Linode's Managed Settings View** ([GET /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](/docs/api/managed/#linodes-managed-settings-view))
        * **Linode's Managed Settings Update** ([PUT /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](/docs/api/managed/#linodes-managed-settings-update))

      description: |
        Configure shared IPs.

        IP sharing allows IP address reassignment (also referred to as IP failover) from one Linode to another if the primary Linode becomes unresponsive. This means that requests to the primary Linode's IP address can be automatically rerouted to secondary Linodes at the configured shared IP addresses.

        IP failover requires configuration of a failover service (such as [Keepalived](/docs/guides/ip-failover-keepalived)) within the internal system of the primary Linode.

        This command is equivalent to **IP Addresses Assign** ([POST /networking/ips/assign](#ip-addresses-assign)).

        Assign multiple IPv4 addresses and/or IPv6 ranges to multiple Linodes in one Region. This allows swapping, shuffling, or otherwise reorganizing IPs to your Linodes.

        The following restrictions apply:
        * All Linodes involved must have at least one public IPv4 address after assignment.
        * Linodes may have no more than one assigned private IPv4 address.
        * Linodes may have no more than one assigned IPv6 range.

        [Open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open) to request additional IPv4 addresses or IPv6 ranges beyond standard account limits.

        **Note**: Removing an IP address that has been set as a Managed Linode's `ssh.ip` causes the Managed Linode's SSH access settings to reset to their default values. To view and configure Managed Linode SSH settings, use the following commands:
        * **Linode's Managed Settings View** ([GET /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](/docs/api/managed/#linodes-managed-settings-view))
        * **Linode's Managed Settings Update** ([PUT /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](/docs/api/managed/#linodes-managed-settings-update))

      summary: VLANs List
      description: |
        Returns a list of all Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) on your Account. VLANs provide
        a mechanism for secure communication between two or more Linodes that are assigned to the
        same VLAN and are both within the same Layer 2 broadcast domain.

        VLANs are created and attached to Linodes by using the `interfaces` property for the following endpoints:

        - Linode Create ([POST /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create))
        - Configuration Profile Create ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-create))
        - Configuration Profile Update ([PUT /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs/{configId}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-update))

        There are several ways to detach a VLAN from a Linode:

        - [Update](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-update) the active Configuration Profile to remove the VLAN interface, then [reboot](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-reboot) the Linode.
        - [Create](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-create) a new Configuration Profile without the VLAN interface, then [reboot](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-reboot) the Linode into the new Configuration Profile.
        - [Delete](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-delete) the Linode.

        **Note:** Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Use the Regions ([/regions](/docs/api/regions/)) endpoint to view the capabilities of data center regions.
        If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center,
        the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility,
        you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

        **Note:** See the [VLANs Overview](/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) to view additional specifications and limitations.

      description: |
        Creates a NodeBalancer in the requested Region.

        NodeBalancers require a port Config with at least one backend Node to start serving requests.

        When using the Linode CLI to create a NodeBalancer, first create a NodeBalancer without any Configs. Then, create Configs and Nodes for that NodeBalancer with the respective [Config Create](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#config-create) and [Node Create](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#node-create) commands.

        Once completed, this NodeBalancer will no longer
        respond to requests on the given port. This also deletes all

      summary: Object Storage Bucket Remove

        Removes a single bucket.

        Bucket objects must be removed prior to removing the bucket. While buckets containing objects _may_ be
        deleted using the [s3cmd command-line tool](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/s3cmd/#delete-a-bucket), such operations
        can fail if the bucket contains too many objects. The recommended
        way to empty large buckets is to use the [S3 API to configure lifecycle policies](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/bucketpolicy/#) that
        remove all objects, then delete the bucket.

      description: |
        Send a one-time verification code via SMS message to the submitted phone number. Providing your phone number helps ensure you can securely access your Account in case other ways to connect are lost. Your phone number is only used to verify your identity by sending an SMS message. Standard carrier messaging fees may apply.

        * By accessing this command you are opting in to receive SMS messages. You can opt out of SMS messages by using the **Phone Number Delete** ([DELETE /profile/phone-number](/docs/api/profile/#phone-number-delete)) command after your phone number is verified.

        * Verification codes are valid for 10 minutes after they are sent.

        * Subsequent requests made prior to code expiration result in sending the same code.

        Once a verification code is received, verify your phone number with the **Phone Number Verify** ([POST /profile/phone-number/verify](/docs/api/profile/#phone-number-verify)) command.

            `NS`: The subdomain, if any, to use with the Domain of the Record. Wildcard NS records (`*`) are not supported.

            `MX`: The mail subdomain. For example, `sub` for the address `user@sub.example.com` under the `example.com`
            Domain. Must be an empty string (`""`) for a Null MX Record.

            `CNAME`: The hostname. Must be unique. Required.

            `TXT`: The hostname.

            `SRV`: Unused. Use the `service` property to set the service name for this record.

            `CAA`: The subdomain. Omit or enter an empty string (`""`) to apply to the entire Domain.

            `PTR`: See our guide on how to [Configure Your Linode for Reverse DNS

            on the type of record this represents:

            `A` and `AAAA`: The IP address. Use `[remote_addr]` to submit the IPv4 address of the request. Required.

            `NS`: The name server. Must be a valid domain. Required.

            `MX`: The mail server. Must be a valid domain unless creating a Null MX Record. To create a
            [Null MX Record](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7505), first
            [remove](/docs/api/domains/#domain-record-delete) any additional MX records, create an MX record with empty strings
            (`""`) for the `target` and `name`. If a Domain has a Null MX record, new MX records cannot be created. Required.

            `CNAME`: The alias. Must be a valid domain. Required.

            `TXT`: The value. Required.

            `SRV`: The target domain or subdomain. If a subdomain is entered, it is automatically used with the Domain.
            To configure for a different domain, enter a valid FQDN. For example, the value `www` with a Domain for
            `example.com` results in a target set to `www.example.com`, whereas the value `sample.com` results in a
            target set to `sample.com`. Required.

            `CAA`: The value. For `issue` or `issuewild` tags, the domain of your certificate issuer. For the `iodef`
            tag, a contact or submission URL (domain, http, https, or mailto). Requirements depend on the tag for this record:
              * `issue`: The domain of your certificate issuer. Must be a valid domain.
              * `issuewild`: The domain of your wildcard certificate issuer. Must be a valid domain and must not start with an asterisk (`*`).
              * `iodef`: Must be either (1) a valid domain, (2) a valid domain prepended with `http://` or `https://`, or (3) a valid email address prepended with `mailto:`.

            `PTR`: Required. See our guide on how to [Configure Your Linode for Reverse DNS

                Some Event entities do not have IDs associated with them, so they
                will not be returned when filtering by ID. These Events include:
                  * `account`
                  * `profile`

                Entities for some Events are assigned the ID of the Linode they correspond to.
                When filtering by ID for these Events, use the corresponding Linode's ID.
                These Events include:
                  * `disks`
                  * `backups`


                Tag Events use a tag's name for the entity ID field. When filtering by ID
                for tag Events, supply the name of the tag.

              share some qualities with the host, ultimately making it run faster since

            May only consist of ASCII letters, numbers, and dashes (`-`).

            Only used for `vlan` purpose interfaces. Must be an empty string or `null` for `public` purpose interfaces.

            The Linode is configured to use this address for the associated interface upon reboot if Network Helper is enabled. If Network Helper is disabled, the address can be enabled with [manual static IP configuration](/docs/guides/manual-network-configuration/).

            Must be unique among the Linode's interfaces.

            * `public`
              * Only one `public` interface per Linode can be defined.
              * The Linode's default public IPv4 address is assigned to the `public` interface.
              * A Linode must have a public interface in the first/eth0 position to be reachable via the public internet upon boot without additional system configuration. If no `public` interface is configured, the Linode is not directly reachable via the public internet. In this case, access can only be established via LISH or other Linodes connected to the same VLAN.

            * `vlan`
              * Configuring a `vlan` purpose interface attaches this Linode to the VLAN with the specified `label`.
              * The Linode is configured to use the specified `ipam_address`, if any.

      description: |
        An array of Network Interfaces to add to this Linode's Configuration Profile.

        Up to three interface objects can be entered in this array. The position in the array determines the interface to which the settings apply:

        - First/0:  eth0
        - Second/1: eth1
        - Third/2:  eth2

        When updating a Linode's interfaces, *each interface must be redefined*. An empty interfaces array results in a default public interface configuration only.

        If no public interface is configured, public IP addresses are still assigned to the Linode but will not be usable without manual configuration.

        **Note:** Changes to Linode interface configurations can be enabled by rebooting the Linode.

        **Note:** Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Use the Regions ([/regions](/docs/api/regions/)) endpoint to view the capabilities of data center regions.
        If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center,
        the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility,
        you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

        **Note:** See the [VLANs Overview](/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) guide to view additional specifications and limitations.

                1 GB Linodes in the Cloud Manager, however, the API, the CLI, and billing will

              * standard - Standard Shared instances are good for medium-duty workloads and
                are a good mix of performance, resources, and price. **Note:** As of June 16th, 2020,
                Standard Linodes in the Cloud Manager became Shared Linodes, however, the API, the CLI, and
                billing will continue to refer to these instances as Standard Linodes.
              * dedicated - Dedicated CPU instances are good for full-duty workloads
                where consistent performance is important.
              * gpu - Linodes with dedicated NVIDIA Quadro &reg; RTX 6000 GPUs accelerate highly
                specialized applications such as machine learning, AI, and video transcoding.
              * highmem - High Memory instances favor RAM over other resources, and can be
                good for memory hungry use cases like caching and in-memory databases.
                All High Memory plans contain dedicated CPU cores.

                sequences of their Unicode code points. For example, the

                Unicode code point is 2 bytes (`0x30AB`). APIv4 supports this
                character and the API will return it as the escape sequence
                using six 1 byte characters which represent 2 bytes of Unicode
                code point (`"\u30ab"`).
              * 4 byte UTF-8 characters are not supported.
              * If the label is entirely composed of UTF-8 characters, the API
                response will return the code points using up to 193 1 byte
                characters.

              Limited Access Keys can:

              * [list all buckets](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-buckets-list) available on this Account, but cannot perform any actions on a bucket unless it has access to the bucket.


              * [create new buckets](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-bucket-create), but do not have any access to the buckets it creates, unless explicitly given access to them.

            This account's Cloud Manager authentication type. Authentication types are chosen through
            Cloud Manager and authorized when logging into your account. These authentication types are either
            the user's password (in conjunction with their username), or the name of their
            indentity provider such as GitHub. For example, if a user:

            - Has never used Third-Party Authentication, their authentication type will be `password`.
            - Is using Third-Party Authentication, their authentication type will be the name of their Identity Provider (eg. `github`).
            - Has used Third-Party Authentication and has since revoked it, their authentication type will be `password`.

        Promotions generally
        offer a set amount of credit that can be used toward your Linode
        services, and the promotion expires after a specified date. As well,
        a monthly cap on the promotional offer is set.

        Simply put, a promotion offers a certain amount of credit every
        month, until either the expiration date is passed, or until the total
        promotional credit is used, whichever comes first.
