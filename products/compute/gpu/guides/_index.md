## Building Blocks

- [Install NVIDIA Driver Dependencies](/docs/products/compute/gpu/guides/install-nvidia-driver-dependencies/): Before installing the driver, youâ€™ll need some dependencies.

- [NVIDIA Driver CUDA Installation](/docs/products/compute/gpu/guides/install-nvidia-drivers-with-cuda/): If you're running Ubuntu 18.04, CentOS 7, or OpenSUSE, install the NVIDIA driver with CUDA.

- [NVIDIA Driver Manual Installation](/docs/products/compute/gpu/guides/install-nvidia-drivers-manually/): If you're running Debian 9, install the NVIDIA driver manually.

## Themes

These guides will help you with targeted topics like the basics of GPU Linodes, and how to decide if GPU Linodes are right for you.
