## Features

### Competition-Free Resources

Hypervisor resources for Dedicated CPU Linodes are not shared. The vCPU threads are assigned exclusively to cores and SMT threads on the hypervisor. This allows you to run workloads that require full-duty work (100% CPU all day, every day) at top performance.

## Pricing
