>>> Essential steps go here--usually enabling the service and/or adding the user's first primitive for the product in question (but not editing/configuring existing primitives or removing them, etc).

>>> I've been avoiding including images in the Get Started tab, generally. This makes sense to me, as it keeps the instructions "compressed".

>>> Because the ones I've added to the repo haven't had images, while the miniguides/shortguides largely do have images, I haven't been embedding the shortguides in this tab, generally.
