## Linode API

Linodeâ€™s API v4 provides the ability to programmatically manage the full range of Linode products and services. View the [Object Storage API Endpoint Collection](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/object-storage-buckets).

## Linode CLI

The Linode CLI is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that allows you to manage your Linode account and resources from the command line. Learn how to use the Linode CLI to [create and manage Object Storage](/docs/platform/api/linode-cli/#object-storage).
