Take content from https://github.com/linode/docs and move and, where needed, convert it.

This will be a work in progress, but the goal is that it should be possible to repeatedly run this script on the complete source. This way we can do one final and full conversion before we go live.

Run it with `./main.go` ... or `go run main.go` or use `go build` to create a binary. Needs Go installed.
