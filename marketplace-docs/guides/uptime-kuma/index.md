[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) is an open source monitoring tool. It enables you to monitor services over HTTP/S, TCP, DNS, and other protocols. You can receive notification alerts of downtime and even create custom status pages for your users.

### Obtain the Credentials

Once the app is deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

To obtain credentials:

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console**: Log in to Cloud Manager, click the **Linodes** link in the left menu, and select the Compute Instance you just deployed. Click **Launch LISH Console**. Log in as the `root` user. To learn more, see [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH**: Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. To learn how, see [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/).

1.  Run the following command to access the credentials file:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

This returns passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Save them. Once saved, you can safely delete the file.

## Getting Started After Deployment

To get started:

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you entered when creating the instance: `https://domain.tld`. If you didn't enter a domain, use your Compute Instance's default rDNS domain (`192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). To learn more on viewing the rDNS value, see [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/). Make sure to use the `https` prefix in the URL to access the website securely.

1. Check [the official Uptime Kuma Repository](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) to learn how you can use your Uptime Kuma instance.
