### Obtain the Credentials

Once the app is deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

To obtain the credentials:

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console**: Log in to Cloud Manager, click the **Linodes** link in the left menu, and select the Compute Instance you just deployed. Click **Launch LISH Console**. Log in as the `root` user. To learn more, see [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH**: Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. To learn how, see [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/).

1.  Run the following command to access the credentials file:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

This returns passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Save them. Once saved, you can safely delete the file.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Rocket.Chat App

1.  Open a browser and navigate to the domain you created in the beginning of your deployment. You can also use your Compute Instance's rDNS, which will appear like `203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing and setting the rDNS value.

1.  Enter your credentials which can be found in the credentials file on the server.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your Rocket.Chat instance, check out [the official Rocket.Chat documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides) to learn how to use the instance.
