OpenBao is an open source solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys. This project is a forked alternative to Vault managed by the Linux Foundation, and development is driven by the community.

{{< note type="warning" title="OpenBao is still early in development" >}}
While OpenBao is a fork of a production-ready 1.14.x release of Hashicorp Vault, the OpenBao codebase is still early in development and is subject to change as development takes place. We recommend following the [release cycles](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/releases) for any breaking changes to minimize any downtime on a production environment.

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** OpenBao should be fully installed within 5-7 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Suggested minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used. For best results, use a 8GB Dedicated CPU or Shared Compute Instance.

### OpenBao Options

{{% content "marketplace-custom-domain-fields-shortguide" %}}
- **List of IP addresses to whitelist:** A list of IP address that will be whitelisted for OpenBao. These should be client IPs that will need to obtain secrets from your OpenBao instance.
- **Country or region** *(required)*: Enter the country or region for you or your organization.
- **State or province** *(required)*: Enter the state or province for you or your organization.
- **Locality** *(required)*: Enter the town or other locality for you or your organization.
- **Organization** *(required)*: Enter the name of your organization.
- **Email address** *(required)*: Enter the email address you wish to use for your certificate file.

## Getting Started After Deployment

Once the deployment is complete, OpenBao is installed and ready to use. You can SSH into your machine and obtain the credentials found in the `.credentials` file in the sudo users home directory `/home/$SUDO_USER/.credentials`.

1.  `bao` commands can run to continue setting up your OpenBao instance. To confirm, you can run the `bao status` command:

    ```command
    bao status
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    If you receive an error when running the `bao status` command, reload the environment variable by sourcing your server's bashrc file:

    ```command
    source /root/.bashrc
    ```
    {{< /note >}}

2. The OpenBao instance is initialized as part of the deployment. The unseal keys along with the root token can be found in the `.credentials` file in the sudo users home directory `/home/$SUDO_USER/.credentials`.

The unseal keys should be stored in separate locations. For example, store one key in a password manager such as 1Password, encrypted with gpg, and another offline on a USB key. Doing so ensures that compromising one storage location is not sufficient to recover the number of unseal keys required to decrypt the OpenBao database.

The `Initial Root Token` is equivalent to the root or superuser account for the OpenBao API. Record and protect this token in a similar fashion. Like the `root` account on a Unix system, this token should be used to create less-privileged accounts to use for day-to-day interactions with OpenBao and the root token should be used infrequently due to its widespread privileges.

### Unseal OpenBao

After the deployment is complete, OpenBao will be sealed. The following unseal steps must be performed any time the `openbao` service is brought down and then brought up again, such as when performing `systemctl restart openbao` or restarting the host machine.

1.  With `VAULT_ADDR` set appropriately, execute the unseal command.

    ```command
    bao operator unseal
    ```

    A prompt will appear:

    ```output
    Unseal Key (will be hidden):
    ```

2.  Paste or enter one unseal key and press **Enter**. The command will finish with output similar to the following:

    ```output
    Unseal Key (will be hidden):
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    Seal Type          shamir
    Initialized        true
    Sealed             true
    Total Shares       3
    Threshold          2
    Unseal Progress    1/2
    Unseal Nonce        n/a
    Version            2.0.0-alpha20240329
    Storage Type       raft
    HA Enabled         false
    ```

    The output indicates that one out of the two required unseal keys has been provided.

3.  Perform the `unseal` command again.

    ```command
    bao operator unseal
    ```

4.  Enter a _different_ unseal key when the prompt appears.

    ```output
    Unseal Key (will be hidden):
    ```

5.  The resulting output should indicate that OpenBao is now unsealed (`Sealed:false`).

    ```output
    Unseal Key (will be hidden):
    Key                     Value
    ---                     -----
    Seal Type               shamir
    Initialized             true
    Sealed                  false
    Total Shares            3
    Threshold               2
    Version                 2.0.0-alpha20240329
    Build Date              2024-03-29T21:37:50Z
    Storage Type            raft
    Cluster Name            vault-cluster-9b0549a6
    Cluster ID              4cb3e7c0-6ce5-2d54-2549-f88d29cb9691
    HA Enabled              true
    HA Cluster              n/a
    HA Mode                 standby
    Active Node Address     <none>
    Raft Committed Index    27
    Raft Applied Index      27
    ```

OpenBao is now operational.
