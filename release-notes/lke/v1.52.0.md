date: 2023-07-26
version: 1.52.0

### Added

- Ability to force-rotate Service Account tokens without permanently breaking the control-plane.
    - In order to manually rotate Service Account tokens used by the control-plane, delete secrets with the type `kubernetes.io/service-account-token` in the `kube-system` namespace.
    - Deleting `ccm-user-token-*` secrets can still result in a momentary disruption of the control-plane.
    - Deleting `lke-admin-token-*` secrets invalidates the current kubeconfig. Allow some time for the new token to propagate to the control-plane before downloading a new kubeconfig via the API or Cloud Manager.

### Changed

- Upgraded clusters using Kubernetes 1.25 to patch version 1.25.12
- Upgraded clusters using Kubernetes 1.26 to patch version 1.26.7

### Fixed

- Improvements to etcd stability.
