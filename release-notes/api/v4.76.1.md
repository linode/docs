### Added

- You can now upload your own TLS/SSL certificates to your Object Storage buckets. Your TLS/SSL certificates can be self-signed or issued from a CA authority like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). When a user accesses your Object Storage bucket over HTTPS your uploaded TLS/SSL certificate is served. The following Object Storage endpoints have been added to the APIv4:

    - Upload Object Storage TLS/SSL Cert ([POST /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}/ssl](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-tlsssl-cert-upload))
    - View Object Storage TLS/SSL Cert ([GET /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}/ssl](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-tlsssl-cert-view))
    - Delete Object Storage TLS/SSL Cert ([DELETE /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}/ssl](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-tlsssl-cert-delete))
