### Changed

- The limit of Firewalls per Linode service has been increased from 3 to 5. Descriptions for Firewall ([/networking](/docs/api/networking/)) beta endpoints were updated to reflect this increase.

- The description for the User Create ([POST /account/users](/docs/api/account/#user-create)) endpoint has been updated to include details for the email confirmation that is sent to newly-created Users.

- The description for the Kubernetes Cluster Recycle ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/recycle](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubernetes-cluster-recycle)) endpoint has been updated to include more descriptive language regarding recycling all Nodes within an LKE Cluster.

### Fixed

- Descriptions for Object Storage ([/object-storage](/docs/api/object-storage/)) endpoints contained broken links to S3 API documentation. These links have been fixed.
