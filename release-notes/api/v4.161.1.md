### Fixed

* **Firewall Create** ([POST /networking/firewalls](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-create))

  **Firewall Rule Update** ([PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId}/rules](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-rules-update))

  * This release includes documentation fixes regarding creating and updating Cloud Firewall rules with these commands. Previously, we stated that inbound and outbound rules _required_ defined `ports` except for the ICMP and IPENCAP protocols. However, `ports` is _optional_ for the TCP and UDP protocols and disallowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP protocols. Additionally, if `ports` is undefined, then all ports are affected by the Firewall rule.

  * These commands also now provide additional details for configuring Cloud Firewall rules, including instructions on how to apply rules to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
