### Added

- **Linode Assign IPs** ([POST /networking/ips/assign](/docs/api/networking/#linodes-assign-ips)):
    - Manage both IPv4 address and IPv6 range assignments to your Linodes with this command.
    - This command was formerly located at [POST /networking/ipv4/assign](/docs/api/networking/#linodes-assign-ipv4s), which has been re-named to **Linode Assign IPv4s**.

- **IPv6 Range Create** ([POST /networking/ipv6/ranges](/docs/api/networking/#ipv6-range-create)):
    - Create /54 or /64 IPv6 ranges for your Linodes with this command.

- **IPv4 Range Delete** ([DELETE /networking/ipv6/ranges/{range}](/docs/api/networking/#ipv6-range-delete)):
    - Delete IPv6 ranges with this command.

### Fixed

- When assigning a VLAN to a Linode, you can now omit or enter an empty string for the Linode's `interfaces.ipam_address`. This fix affects the following endpoints:
    - **Linode Create** ([POST /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create))
    - **Configuration Profile Create** ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-create))
    - **Configuration Profile Update** ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs/{configId}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-update))
