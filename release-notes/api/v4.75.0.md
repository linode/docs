### Added

[Linode Cloud Firewall](https://www.linode.com/products/firewall/) is now available in the Sydney data center as part our [Linode Green Light Beta Program](https://www.linode.com/green-light/). Cloud Firewall is a free service used to create, configure, and add stateful network-based firewalls to Linode services using the Linode Cloud Manager and the Linode APIv4. A Cloud Firewall is independent of the service it is attached to, so you can apply a single Firewall to multiple Linode services. Currently, a Cloud Firewall can only be applied to [Linode instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create).

- Cloud Firewall beta endpoints have been added to the Networking collection. **Note**: These endpoints are prepended with **`/v4beta`** instead of `/v4`.
