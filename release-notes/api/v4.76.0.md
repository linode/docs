### Added

- When you have active [Domains](/docs/api/domains/#domains-list) on your [Account](/docs/api/account/#account-view), but no active [Linodes](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linodes-list), your domains are not served. The List Notifications ([GET /account/notifications](/docs/api/account/#notifications-list)) endpoint now returns a notification to alert you when your Account falls under this case.

- The [NodeBalancers endpoints](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#nodebalancers-list) error messages were improved to include information about a field's valid values.

### Fixed

- The APIv4 now returns a warning when you execute a staged/approved PayPal payment ([POST /account/payments/paypal/execute](/docs/api/account/#stagedapproved-paypal-payment-execute)) and your payment is successfully processed, but an error occurs related to releasing a service suspension. Prior to this fix, a `500` error occurred instead.

- Now, when you have an outstanding balance on your account, adding more nodes to a Kubernetes Cluster fails. An error message with `Cannot add or create LKE objects with an outstanding balance on your account` is returned when this occurs. This affects the following endpoints:
    - Create Kubernetes Cluster ([POST /lke/clusters](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubernetes-cluster-create))
    - Create Node Pool ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#node-pool-create))
    - Update Node Pool ([PUT /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#node-pool-update))
    - Recycle Node Pool endpoints. ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}/recycle](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#node-pool-recycle))

- When you attempt to create a Kubernetes cluster ([POST /lke/clusters](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubernetes-cluster-create)) or create a node pool ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#node-pool-create)) with unsupported node types, you receive an error message. Currently, LKE does not support [1 GB Linode instances](https://www.linode.com/products/shared/), or [GPU Linode instances](https://www.linode.com/products/gpu/).

- You can now [create an Object Storage Limited Access Key](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-key-create) without access to any buckets. This is achieved by creating an Object Storage Key with an empty `bucket_access` array. This type of Limited Access Key can:

    - [list all buckets](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-buckets-list) available on your Account, but cannot perform any actions on a bucket.

    - [create new buckets](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-bucket-create), but does not have any access to the buckets it creates.
