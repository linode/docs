### Added

* You can now regenerate Kubernetes Cluster service account tokens by accessing the new **Service Token Delete** ([DELETE /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/servicetoken](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#service-token-delete)) command.

* To help with managing Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the new **Kubernetes Cluster Regenerate** ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/regenerate](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubernetes-cluster-regenerate)) command to regenerate Kubeconfig files and service account tokens with a single request.

### Fixed

* Previously, [Domain](/docs/api/domains/) command requests accepted `domain` and `description` values of up to 255 characters. This resulted in technical domain lengths in violation of [RFC1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035). Accordingly, the maximum character length for `domain` and `description` values has been reduced to 253.

* Fixed several filtering bugs that prevented filtering for [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/) and [Images](/docs/api/images/) by `type`.
