### Added

- Linode's new Mumbai data center is now an available region ([GET /regions](/docs/api/regions/#regions-list)).

- Added a new account cancellation endpoint: [POST /account/cancel](/docs/api/account/#account-cancel). This endpoint accepts an optional comments field and responds with a link to Linode's  exit survey.

- Added a new *profile\_update* event action to the List Events endpoint ([GET /account/events](/docs/api/account/#events-list)) and View Event endpoint ([GET /account/events/{eventId}](/docs/api/account/#event-view)).

    This event will be issued when making requests to the [PUT /profile](/docs/api/profile/#profile-update) and [PUT /profile/preferences](/docs/api/profile/#user-preferences-update) endpoints.

- Added User event actions to the List Events endpoint ([GET /account/events](/docs/api/account/#events-list)) and View Event endpoint ([GET /account/events/{eventId}](/docs/api/account/#event-view)).

    - *user\_create* - This event will be issued when making requests to the [POST /account/users](/docs/api/account/#user-create) endpoint.

    - *user\_update* - This event will be issued when making requests to the [PUT /account/users/{username}](/docs/api/account/#user-update) and [PUT /account/users/{username}/grants](/docs/api/account/#users-grants-update) endpoints.

    - *user\_delete* - This event will be issued when making requests to the [DELETE /account/users/{username}](/docs/api/account/#user-delete) endpoint.

### Changed

- Changed behavior of the *configs* parameter for the [POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-clone) endpoint. When an empty array is passed to the *configs* parameter, no configuration profiles will be cloned from the source Linode.

    Previously, all configuration profiles would be cloned. All behaviors of the *disks* and *configs* parameters for this endpoint are now more extensively documented in the API reference.

### Fixed

- When updating the email of an account ([PUT /account](/docs/api/account/#account-update)) or of a user ([PUT /profile](/docs/api/profile/#profile-update)), Linode will now send an email notification to the previous email address that describes this change.

- Fixed an issue where a user could not set permissions on a domain that contained errors.

- Fixed a malformed URL in the response for the Enable Managed Service endpoint ([POST /managed/services/{serviceId}/enable](/docs/api/managed/#managed-service-enable)).

- Fixed an issue in which SRV records could only be assigned a port number below 32767. Any port number is now accepted.

- Fixed a login error that could appear after a user's session had expired, if the user also had two-factor authentication enabled.

- Reduced response time for the [GET /support/tickets](/docs/api/support/#support-tickets-list) endpoint.
