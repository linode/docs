### Changed

- The Maintenance List ([GET /account/maintenance](/docs/api/account/#maintenance-list)) beta endpoint's "status" property has been updated as follows:
    - Maintenance objects that were formerly returned as `ready` are now returned as `pending`.
    - `completed` Maintenance objects are no longer returned at this endpoint.
