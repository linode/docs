# This workflow builds the site with Hugo, uploads it to a testing web
# server, and updates the sandbox Algolia app to reflect the content in the
# testing version of the site. This happens whenever the
# `feature/testing-linodedocs` branch is updated. We use this testing workflow
# to test new website features, especially docs theme updates that might have
# unexpected interactions with the CDN.
#
# The working directory for this GitHub Action is under:
# /home/runner/work/docs/docs/
#
# For this workflow, two repos are checked out:
# - The github.com/linode/docs repo is checked out into the `docs-repo` folder
# - The github.com/linode/linode-docs-theme repo is checked out into the
#   `linode-docs-theme` folder.
#
# This workflow runs `hugo` to build the site inside the `docs-repo` folder.
# The site is rendered into the `docs-repo/public/` directory. The workflow
# rsyncs this folder is over to the destination web server.
#
# We check out the linode-docs-theme repo because it contains a
# `linode_algolia_admin` tool that we use to update the Algolia search indices.
#
# Inside the docs repo, the go.mod file contains a reference to which git
# commit of the linode-docs-theme is associated with the docs repo.
# We inspect this file to get that commit hash before checking out the
# linode-docs-theme repo.
#
# The following is a diagram of the above-mentioned repos and files. It does not
# show all the files within those repositories:
