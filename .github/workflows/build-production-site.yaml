name: Build production site

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

# This workflow builds the site with Hugo, compresses it, uploads it to an
# object storage bucket, and updates the sandbox Algolia app to reflect the
# content in the production version of the site. Another non-github.com delivery
# system is responsible for deploying the compressed site to a production
# webserver.
#
# This workflow is triggered whenever a release tag matching the `vX.Y.Z`
# format is created on the docs repo.
#
# The working directory for this GitHub Action is under:
# /home/runner/work/docs/docs/
#
# For this workflow, two repos are checked out:
# - The github.com/linode/docs repo is checked out into the `docs-repo` folder
# - The github.com/linode/linode-docs-theme repo is checked out into the
#   `linode-docs-theme` folder.
#
# This workflow runs `hugo` to build the site inside the `docs-repo` folder.
# The site is rendered into the `docs-repo/public/` directory. The workflow
# uses SFTP to upload a tarball of this folder over to the destination web
# servers.
#
# We check out the linode-docs-theme repo because it contains a
# `linode_algolia_admin` tool that we use to update the Algolia search indices.
#
# Inside the docs repo, the go.mod file contains a reference to which git
# commit of the linode-docs-theme is associated with the docs repo.
# We inspect this file to get that commit hash before checking out the
# linode-docs-theme repo.
#
# The following is a diagram of the above-mentioned repos and files. It does not
# show all the files within those repositories:

      # Why build Hugo twice? In order to render the Explore Docs nav menu,
      # Hugo downloads data from the Algolia search backend. However, the
      # first time we build Hugo in this workflow, that data isn't up-to-date
      # with new content we may be publishing. So, we build Hugo a second time
      # after we have performed the previous Update Algolia step.
      # In summary:
      # - Build Hugo the first time in order to render the JSON search index
      #   data files
      # - Update Algolia with those data files
      # - Build Hugo again so that the navigation UI can be rendered with that
      #   updated info from Algolia
      # It's a little redundant, but solves the chicken-or-egg problem
