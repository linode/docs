# Linode Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In order to encourage an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

* age
* body size
* disability
* ethnicity
* gender identity and expression
* level of experience
* nationality
* personal appearance
* race
* religion
* sexual identity and orientation

## Our Standards

You can contribute to creating a positive environment in many ways. For example you can:

* use welcoming and inclusive language
* be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* accept constructive criticism gracefully
* focus on what is best for the community
* show empathy towards other community members
* be helpful and understanding

You should not:

* use sexualized language or imagery
* make unwelcome sexual advances
* troll, and make insulting or derogatory comments
* make personal or political attacks
* harass others, in public or private
* publish others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* engage in any other conduct which could reasonably be considered bullying or inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and we are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:

* comments
* commits
* code
* issues
* other contributions that are not aligned to this code of conduct

We also reserve the right to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors we deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies whenever you are representing the project or community. For example you may be:

* working in a project space online or in the public
* using an official project email address
* posting via an official social media account
* participating in an online or offline event

Project maintainers may further define and clarify representation of a project.

## Enforcement

You should report any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour to the project team at docs@linode.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain the anonymity of the reporter of an incident. We may post further details of specific enforcement policies separately.

Project contributors who do not follow or enforce this code of conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences. These will be determined by members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This code of conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, and the [gov.uk open standards CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
