-   Formatted. Your style should use [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) formatting and match the Linode Library [style guide](docs/style-guide.md).
-   Original. Your content should be original material written for Linode. We will not accept submissions that have been copied from other sources.
