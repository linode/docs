# Update: 07/22/16

Linode's bounty program has been an overwhelming success. Too succesful, in fact! Our inbox and repository are overflowing with proposed articles.

As a four-man team responsible for both internally *and* externally sourced docs, we're in a bit over our collective head. That's why - until further notice - we're no longer accepting new submissions for the Linode bounty program. Any new guides submitted, whether through GitHub or email, after today will be rejected without review.

Rest assured, this is a temporary moratorium. Once we've cleared through the backlog and given the appropriate time and consideration (and, hopefully, payout) to the authors already patiently waiting, we'll resume the bounty program and with it, a revised set of topic requirements.

Please note, if you see the need for a correction in an existing guide, feel free to make a pull request. We still want to improve and update our existing guides, even as we review new ones.

Write Your Article
------------------

Use the [style guide](docs/style-guide.md). While you're writing, make sure your content is:

-   Accurate. Your instructions should be straightforward and technically sound.
-   Formatted. Your style should use [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) formatting and match the Linode Docs [style guide](docs/style-guide.md).
-   Original. Your content should be original material written for Linode. We will not accept submissions that have been copied from other sources.

Want to make sure you don't waste time writing a long article we can't use? First, submit a writing sample to <contribute@linode.com>.

Submit Your Article
-------------------

Submit your article as a pull request or by emailing <contribute@linode.com>. Articles should be sent as a plain text or PHP Markdown Extra file attachment. When submitting through GitHub, please create a new branch for your changes. Writing samples are welcome as well.

Got images? Attach them as **.png** or **.jpg** files. If an image is greater than 650 pixels wide, please send both the original and a 650-pixel-wide version.

Submission checklist:

-   Article in **.txt** or **.md** format
-   Images
-   Your name, as you want it to appear on the site

Once you've submitted your article, here's what you can expect:

1.  You'll receive a brief response acknowledging your submission.
2.  We will do a technical review of your material. This will take a few days.
3.  We will do a copy review of the article. This will take a few days.
4.  You may receive questions or comments from us or a request for a resubmission with a few changes.
5.  We will let you know that your article has been chosen for publication and send you the final version we are planning to publish. You will have 36 hours to respond and approve our publication of the final version.
6.  If you respond positively (non-response will be taken as consent to publish), we will publish the article.
