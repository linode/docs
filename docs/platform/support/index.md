Linode provides live technical support services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Linode Support ensures network availability, verifies that you can access your Linode, resolves performance issues with hosts, and works to fix any service-related issues you may be experiencing.

Linode also offers a number of resources you can refer to when troubleshooting application and server configuration issues. These issues are generally outside the scope of Linode Support, and the other resources Linode provides can help you find solutions for your questions.

## Resources

Linode provides community spaces, an AI-powered assistant, libraries of reference material, and status updates for infrastructure components:

-   **Linode Community and the Community Site:** Customers and staff discuss the projects they're working on in the [Linode Community Site](/community/). You can search this site to see if your issue has already been addressed there. If you can't find any existing posts related to your issue, you can create a new one or ask your question in the [IRC channel](/chat/).

-   **Linode Support Bot:** The Linode Support Bot can answer a number of technical, billing, and account management questions, and it learns new answers every day. If the Linode Support Bot does not know an answer, it can create a support ticket for you. This feature is available from the Linode Manager by clicking the green and white question mark button in the bottom right corner of the page. After clicking this button, a chat panel will slide in from the right side of the page:

-   **Linode Guides & Tutorials:** The [Guides & Tutorials](/docs/) library hosts a catalogued and searchable list of guides on a large number of topics. Here are a few that focus on troubleshooting:

  - The [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting/) quick start guide provides answers for common server connectivity and management issues.

  - The [Linode Beginner's Guide](/docs/platform/linode-beginners-guide/) displays a curated list of the most frequently asked questions from Linode customers.

  - The [Quick Answers](/docs/quick-answers/) section offers short guides with fast answers.

-   **Network Status:** If a data center experiences downtime, Linode's staff will regularly update the [Status webpage](http://status.linode.com/) until the issue has been resolved.
