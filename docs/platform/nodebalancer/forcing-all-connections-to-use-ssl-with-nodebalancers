title: Forcing SSL connections with Nodebalancers
---

The following documentation will assist you with obtaining a valid, commercially signed SSL certificate and installing it on your NodeBalancer. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring a NodeBalancer to redirect all web connections, using SSL, over port 443/HTTPS. Instructions will be provided to configure this with both the Apache and Nginx servers on Debian and Redhat based distributions.

{: .note }
> 
> Please note that commercial SSL certificates require a unique IP address for each certificate. As a result, you will only be able to host one SSL-enabled website, per NodeBalancer

 {: .note }
 > 
> Throughout this guide we will offer several suggested values for specific configuration settings, some of these values will be set by default. These settings are shown in the guide as a reference and you may need to modify them to suit your application accordingly.

Prerequisites
---------------

- When first configuring your back-end Linodes, they should be set up according to the instructions in our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide, and it is suggested that security precautions be implemented. For assistance with this, please see our documentation: [Securing Your Server](https://linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server)

- This guide assumes that you have already deployed two or more backend Linodes and configured them with either a LAMP stack, or a LEMP Stack. If you have not, please review the following supportive documentation for assistance with configuring one:

    - [LAMP Stack](/docs/websites/lamp/)
    - [LEMP Stack](/docs/websites/lemp/)

- In addition, this guide assumes that you have already deployed a NodeBalancer and have configured it with two or more 'Back-end' Linodes that make connections on port 80/HTTP. It is recommended that you first verify that this is configured correctly, prior to introducing the complexities of an encrypted connection over SSL. If you would like assistance with setting up a basic NodeBalancer configuration, please review the following supportive documentation:

   - [Getting Started with NodeBalancers](/docs/platform/nodebalancer/getting-started-with-nodebalancers)
   - [NodeBalancer Reference Guide](/docs/platform/nodebalancer/nodebalancer-reference-guide)

    {: .note}
> This guide is written, assuming that you are logged in as the root user and that you will not need to prepend commands with ``sudo``.

Install OpenSSL
---------------

1. Issue the following commands to update the system and install the required packages for OpenSSL.

 Debian/Ubuntu users:

        apt-get update
        apt-get upgrade
        apt-get install openssl
        mkdir /etc/ssl/localcerts

 CentOS/Fedora users:

        yum install openssl
        mkdir /etc/ssl/localcerts

Create a Certificate Signing Request
------------------------------------

1. Issue the following commands to generate a certificate signing request (CSR) for the domain that you would like to configure with SSL. Be sure to change "www.example.com" to reflect the fully qualified domain name (subdomain.domainname.com) of the site you'll be using SSL with. Leave the challenge password blank. We entered 365 for the days parameter to the command, as we would be paying for one year of SSL certificate verification from a commercial CA (certificate authority).

        cd /etc/ssl/localcerts
    
        openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 365 -keyout www.example.com.key -out www.example.com.csr


 Here are the values we entered for our example certificate. Note that you can ignore the extra attributes.

        Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
        ......................................................++++++
        ....++++++
        writing new private key to 'www.mydomain.com.key'
        -----
        You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
        into your certificate request.
        What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
        There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
        For some fields there will be a default value,
        If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
        -----
        Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
        State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:New Jersey
        Locality Name (eg, city) []:Absecon
        Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:MyDomain, LLC
        Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Web Services
        Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:www.example.com
        Email Address []:support@mydomain.com

        Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
        to be sent with your certificate request
        A challenge password []:
        An optional company name []:




2. A `certificate signing request` file, ending with `.csr`, file will be generated and placed in `/etc/ssl/localcerts`. An example of what this file will look like can be found below (yours will be unique):

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
        MIICpDCCAYwCAQAwRTELMAkGA1UEBhMCQVUxEzARBgNVBAgMClNvbWUtU3RhdGUx
        ITAfBgNVBAoMGEludGVybmV0IFdpZGdpdHMgUHR5IEx0ZDCCASIwDQYJKoZIhvcN
        AQEBBQADggEPADCCAQoCggEBAOGpH/RP26JljSy1Dbt/R6zU5V/cWQd8CMKwzUba
        (additional encrypted data... the cropped text is not important)

        hofUVA2XXBs=
        -----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

3. In addition, a key file ending with `.key`, file will be generated and placed in `/etc/ssl/localcerts`. Execute the following command to protect the key:

        chmod 400 /etc/ssl/localcerts/www.mydomain.com.key 

 An example of what this file will look like can be found below (yours will be unique):

        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQDhqR/0T9uiZY0s

        -----END PRIVATE KEY----

### Submit your CSR to a Certificate Authority

4. You may now submit the contents of this file to a commercial SSL provider (Certificate Authority) for signing. Typically, they will provide you with a field to paste the contents of your CSR file into, somewhere on their website. The following is a list of well known commercial SSL vendors, provided for your convenience:

-   [Verisign](https://www.verisign.com/)
-   [Thawte](https://www.thawte.com/)
-   [Globalsign](https://www.globalsign.com/en/)
-   [Comodo](https://www.comodo.com/)

 {:.note}
> 
> There are many vendors, including some listed above, that provide free SSL certificates. However, free SSL certificates typically have shorter expiration dates, and less features.

5. Once this request has been submitted, you will receive a commercially signed SSL certificate file, which will look similar to the following (yours will be unique):

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIFSzCCBDOgAwIBAgIQVjCXC0bF9U8FypJOnL9cuDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCB
        kDELMAkGA1UEBhMCR0IxGzAZBgNVBAgTEkdyZWF0ZXIgTWFuY2hlc3RlcjEQMA4G
        A1UEBxMHU2FsZm9yZDEaMBgGA1UEChMRQ09NT0RPIENBIExpbWl0ZWQxNjA0BgNV
        (additional encrypted data... the cropped text is not important)

        DCQzME2NkT1ZdW8fdz+Y
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

6. Save this file as /etc/ssl/localcerts/www.mydomain.com.crt. Execute the following command to protect the signed certificate:

        chmod 400 /etc/ssl/localcerts/www.mydomain.com.crt

### Preparing a Chained SSL Certificate

7. However, you may receive several files ending with `.crt`. If this is the case, then they are collectively refereed to as a `chained SSL certificate` and must be concatenated into one file in order to provide full support with most browsers. The following example uses a chained SSL certificate that was signed by Comodo, but other vendors are perfectly reputable as well. Enter the following command to do this:

        cat example_com.crt COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt  COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt > chained-ssl.crt

 The contents of the resulting file will appear similar to the following (yours will be unique):

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIFSzCCBDOgAwIBAgIQVjCXC0bF9U8FypJOnL9cuDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCB

8. If you have concatenated a chained SSL certificate, save this file as `/etc/ssl/localcerts/www.mydomain.com.crt`. Then execute the following command to protect the signed certificate:

        chmod 400 /etc/ssl/localcerts/www.mydomain.com.crt
        
        
 {: .note }
 > 
 > It is an excellent choice to save all of your `.crt` and `.key` files in an offsite location, optionally in a password protected archive. By doing so, you can recover them if neccessary.

Installing the SSL Certificate and Private Key on your NodeBalancer
---------------------------

### Create a configuration profile for Port 443 on your Nodebalancer


### Certificate and Private Key

1. If you select the HTTPS protocol, the **Certificate** and **Private Key** fields will appear.

 [![The NodeBalancer Certificate and Private Key fields.](/docs/assets/1354-nodebalancer_cert.png)](/docs/assets/1354-nodebalancer_cert.png)

2. Copy the contents of your SSL certificate into the **Certificate** field. If you have concatenated multiple segments of a chained certificate, be sure to copy all of it's contents into the text field, appearing one after the other.

3. Copy your passphraseless private key into the **Private Key** field.

4. On your NodeBalancer `Configurations` page, select `Create Configuration`, you will need to create one for each port/protocol that you would like to use, i.e. `80` and `443`.

5. Under `Edit Configuration`  Once selected, fill out the values in the fields as shown below:
 
         **Port**                    443
         **Protocol**                HTTPS
         **Algorithm**               Round Robin
         **Session Stickiness**      None
         **Certificate**             < Insert your signed SSL Certificate >
         **Private Key**             < Insert your Private Key >
         **Health Check Type**       HTTP Valid Status
         **Check Interval**          5
         **Check Timeout**           3
         **Check Attempts**          2
         **Check HTTP Path**         /

Then, select **`Save Changes`**. 

6. Add as many nodes as you require for the port configuration by selecting **`Add Node`**. Once selected, fill out the values in the fields like so:

         **Label**                   < Backend Linode 1 >
         **Address**                 < xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80 >
         **Weight**                  100
         **Mode**                    Accept

{: .note }
> 
> In the section labelled **`Address`**,  you will need to replace `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` by specify the private IP address that has been provisioned for that particular Linode, followed by a colon and `80`. This is because SSL is terminating at the NodeBalancer.

Then, select **`Save Changes`**.


Configuring your Web Server with a 301 Redirect
---------------------------

### Configuring the Apache Webserver.

1. Enable mod_rewrite so that you can redirect all traffic back to the NodeBalancer over port 443/HTTPS. Enter the following command:

        a2enmod rewrite
     
   or, you can load the module manually by appending the following to your Apache configuration file:

  {:.note}
 >     LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

   > Depending on if you are using a Debian or a Redhat based distribution, this file will be located in one of the following locations:
       
 >      /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
 >    
 >      /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

2. Now edit the Apache vhost configuration file to establish the rewrite rules necessary in order to redirect all incoming traffic from port 80/HTTP, back to the NodeBalancer on port 443/HTTPS:

   {: .file-excerpt }
   /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf
      :   ~~~ apache
        
            <VirtualHost *:80>
                ServerAdmin      admin@example.com
	        ServerName       example.com
	        ServerAlias      www.example.com
	        DocumentRoot     /var/www/example.com/public_html/
	        ErrorLog         /var/www/example.com/logs/error.log
	        CustomLog        /var/www/example.com/logs/access.log combined
	        RewriteEngine    On
	        RewriteCond      %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
	        RewriteRule      ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301,NE]
	        RewriteLog       /var/log/apache2/rewrite.log
	        RewriteLogLevel  5
	    </VirtualHost>

   ~~~
   
   3. Create the RewriteLog as referenced from above:

            mkdir /var/log/apache2/rewrite.log

### Configuring your vhost file for the Nginx Webserver.

   4. Now edit the Nginx vhost configuration file to establish the rewrite rules necessary in order to redirect all incoming traffic from port 80/HTTP, back to the NodeBalancer on port 443/HTTPS:

   {: .file-excerpt }
   /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf
      :   ~~~ nginx
 
         server {
                 listen   80;
                 server_name example.com;
                 access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
                 error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
                 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                     location / {
                     root   /srv/www/example.com/public_html;
                     index  index.html index.htm;
                         if ($http_x_forwarded_proto = "http") {
                         rewrite  ^/(.*)$  https://example.com/$1 permanent;
                                                               }           
                                }
                }


   ~~~

Tips for Troubleshooting
---------------------------

- If you end up having difficulty getting the redirect to work properly or would like to see detailed information about how your SSL certificate is configured, you may wish to utilize the following tool from Qualys:

 - [Qualys online SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)

- Every time that you make changes to your web server's document root file or other configuration files, be sure to reload the server:
 
        service apache2 reload
        systemctl restart apache2.service
    
        service nginx reload
        systemctl restart nginx.service

- When testing behind a load balancer, using curl with the `-IL` flags can be very helpful when debugging:
     
        curl -IL example.com
