You can make any of your Account StackScripts public. When an account StackScript is public it will become available to the rest of the Linode Community in the Cloud Manager as a Community StackScript.

{{< caution >}}
Once you make an Account StackScript public, you will not be able to make it private again or to delete it. You can, however, edit your public StackScript, if needed.
{{</ caution >}}

1. Log into the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/).

1. Click on the **StackScripts** link in the left-hand navigation menu. You will be brought to the *StackScripts* page.

1. Viewing the **Account StackScripts** tab, you will see a list of all of your account's StackScripts. This will include both private and public StackScripts. Click on the **more options ellipsis** corresponding to the StackScript you'd like to make public and select **Make StackScript Public** from the dropdown menu.

    A dialog box will appear asking you to confirm the action. Click on **Yes, make me a star!** if you would like to proceed. You will be brought back to the Account StackScripts page.

    {{< note >}}
Your public [Account StackScript](/docs/platform/stackscripts/how-to-deploy-a-new-linode-using-a-stackscript/#account-stackscripts) will be available to you for use as an Account StackScripts page. For Linode Community members, your StackScript will be available to them as a [Community StackScripts](/docs/platform/stackscripts/how-to-deploy-a-new-linode-using-a-stackscript/#community-stackscripts) page.
