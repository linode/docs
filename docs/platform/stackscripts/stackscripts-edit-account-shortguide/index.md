After you've created an Account StackScript, you can go back and edit it as required. This section will show you how to access a StackScript for editing.

1. Log into the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/).

1. Click on the **StackScripts** link in the left-hand navigation menu. You will be brought to the *StackScripts* page.

1. Viewing the **Account StackScripts** tab, you will see a list of all of your account's StackScripts. This will include both private and public StackScripts. Click on the **more options ellipsis** corresponding to the StackScript you'd like to modify and select **Edit** from the dropdown menu.
