## What are StackScripts?

[StackScripts](http://linode.com/stackscripts/) provide Linode users with the ability to automate the deployment of custom systems on top of Linode's default Linux distribution images. For example, every time you deploy a new Linode you might execute the same tasks, like updating your system's software, installing your favorite Linux tools, and adding a limited user account. These tasks can be automated using a StackScript that will perform these actions for you as part of your Linode's first boot process.

All StackScripts are stored in the Linode Cloud Manager and can be accessed whenever you deploy a Linode. A StackScript authored by you is an *Account StackScript*. While a *Community StackScript* is a StackScript created by a Linode community member that has made their StackScript publicly available in the Linode Cloud Manager.

### In this Guide

This guide will show you how to do the following:

- [Create a new StackScript](#create-a-new-stackscript)
- [Edit an Account StackScript](#edit-an-account-stackscript)
- [Make your Account StackScript Public](#make-an-account-stackscript-public)
- [Delete an Account StackScript](#delete-an-account-stackscript)

## Next Steps

Now that you have created a StackScript, you can deploy a Linode using your StackScript. See the [Deploying a New Linode Using a StackScript](/docs/platform/stackscripts/how-to-deploy-a-new-linode-using-a-stackscript/) guide for details.
