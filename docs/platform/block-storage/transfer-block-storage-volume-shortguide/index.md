1. Follow the steps to safely detach your volume as mentioned in [How to Detach a Block Storage Volume from a Linode]
(/docs/platform/block-storage/how-to-use-block-storage-with-your-linode/#how-to-detach-a-block-storage-volume-from-a-linode).

1.   Click the **more options ellipsis** to open the menu for the Volume you want to attach to a Linode and select **Attach**:

1.   Since the Volume already has a filesystem on it, create a mountpoint for the new Linode, provided it hasn't already been created:

        mkdir /mnt/BlockStorage1

1.   Mount the new Volume, where FILE_SYSTEM_PATH is your Volumeâ€™s file system path:

        mount FILE_SYSTEM_PATH /mnt/BlockStorage1

1.  If you want to mount the new Volume automatically every time your Linode boots, you'll want to add the following line to your **/etc/fstab** file:

        FILE_SYSTEM_PATH /mnt/BlockStorage1 ext4 defaults 0 2
