title: How to Use Block Storage with Your Linode
---

Linodeâ€™s Block Storage service allows you to attach additional storage Volumes to your Linode. A single Volume can range from 10 GiB to 10,000 GiB in size and costs $0.10/GiB per month. They can be partitioned however you like and can accommodate any filesystem type you choose. You can attach up to 8 volumes per Linode. The volumes can be newly created or already existing, so you do not need to recreate your server to add a Block Storage Volume.

The Block Storage service is currently available in the Dallas, Fremont, Frankfurt, London, Newark, Tokyo, Toronto, Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney data centers.

{{< caution >}}
-  Linode's backup services do not cover Block Storage Volumes. You must execute [your own backups](/docs/security/backups/backing-up-your-data/) for this data.

-  Your Linode must be running in Paravirtualization mode. Block storage currently does not support Full-virtualization.

## How to Add a Block Storage Volume to a Linode

This guide assumes a Linode with the root disk mounted as `/dev/sda` and swap space mounted as `/dev/sdb`. In this scenario, the Block Storage Volume will be available to the operating system as `/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_EXAMPLE`, where `EXAMPLE` is a label you assign the Volume in the Linode Cloud Manager. Storage Volumes can be added when your Linode is already running, and will show immediately in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.

{{< note >}}
A Linode can have multiple Block Storage Volumes attached to it. However, a Block Storage Volume can only be attached to one Linode at a time.
