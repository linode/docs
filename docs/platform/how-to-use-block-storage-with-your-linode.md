![How to Use Block Storage with Your Linode](/docs/assets/block-storage-title-graphic.png)

Linodeâ€™s Block Storage service allows you to attach additional storage volumes to your Linode. A single volume can range from 10 GiB to 10,000 GiB in size and costs $0.10/GiB per month. They can be partitioned however you like and can accommodate any filesystem type you choose. Up to eight volumes can be attached to a single Linode, be it new or already existing, so you do not need to recreate your server to add a Block Storage Volume.

The Block Storage service is currently available in the Dallas, Fremont, Frankfurt, and Newark datacenters only.

{{< caution >}}
-  Linode's backup services do not cover Block Storage Volumes. You must execute [your own backups](/docs/security/backups/backing-up-your-data/) for this data.

-  Your Linode must be running in Paravirtualization mode. Block storage currently does not support Full-virtualization.

## How to Add a Block Storage Volume to a Linode

This guide assumes a Linode with the root disk mounted as `/dev/sda` and swap space mounted as `/dev/sdb`. In this scenario, the Block Storage Volume will be available to the operating system as `/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_EXAMPLE`, where `EXAMPLE` is a label you assign the volume in the Linode Manager. Storage volumes can be added when your Linode is already running, and will show immediately in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.

### Add a Volume from the Linode Dashboard

1.  Go to the dashboard page of the Linode to which you want to attach a Block Storage Volume. Select **Create a new Volume**:

    [![Linode Manager create a Volume](/docs/assets/bs-manager-create-new-volume.png)](/docs/assets/bs-manager-create-new-volume.png)

2.  Assign the Block Storage Volume a label and size. The label can be up to 32 characters long and consist only of ASCII characters `a-z; 0-9.-_`. The maximum volume size is 10,000 GiB. When finished, click *Add this Volume!*:

    {{< note >}}
There is currently a soft limit of 100 TB of Block Storage Volume per account.
{{< /note >}}

3.  Once you add a volume, you'll be presented with the Volume Attached page as shown below. This page provides customized instructions which show you how to make a filesystem in your volume from any of our supported Linux distributions. The page shows how to mount the volume, and how to add it to `/etc/fstab` so it's mounted automatically whenever you reboot your Linode:

    [![Linode Manager volume instructions](/docs/assets/bs-volume-instructions-small.png)](/docs/assets/bs-volume-instructions.png)

4.  If your Linode is not already running, boot and SSH into your Linode to execute the commands as shown on the instructions page. If you need to see the volume mount instructions again, click **Edit** to the right of the volume in that Linode's dashboard:

    [![Linode Manager edit volume](/docs/assets/bs-edit.png)](/docs/assets/bs-edit.png)

### Add a Volume from Your Account's Volume List

1.  In the **Linodes** tab of Linode manager, click **Manage Volumes** to see your account's volume list:

    [![Linode Manager add volume](/docs/assets/bs-manage-volumes-small.png)](/docs/assets/bs-manage-volumes.png)

2.  Click the **Attach** option for the volume you want to attach to a Linode:

    [![Linode Manager add volume](/docs/assets/bs-volume-list-small.png)](/docs/assets/bs-volume-list.png)

3.  Select the label of the Linode you want to attach the volume to. Then click **Attach**:

## How to Detach a Block Storage Volume from a Linode

1.  Go back to the dashboard of the Linode which the volume is attached to. Shut down the Linode.

2.  When the Linode is powered off, click **Detach** under the **Volumes** list:

    [![Linode Manager detach volume](/docs/assets/bs-detach.png)](/docs/assets/bs-detach.png)

3.  A confirmation screen appears and explains that the volume will be detached from the Linode. Click **Detach** to confirm:

    [![Linode Manager detach volume confirmation](/docs/assets/bs-detach-confirm-small.png)](/docs/assets/bs-detach-confirm.png)

    The Linode's dashboard does not show the volume present anymore:

    [![Linode Manager detached volume](/docs/assets/bs-detached.png)](/docs/assets/bs-detached.png)

    The volume still exists on your account and you can see it if you click **View all Volumes**:

## How to Delete a Block Storage Volume

{{< caution >}}
The removal process is irreversible, and the data will be permanently deleted.
{{< /caution >}}

1.  Shut down the Linode.

2.  Detach the volume as described [above](#how-to-detach-a-block-storage-volume-from-a-linode).

3.  Click the volume's **Remove** option in either the volume list or the attached Linode's dashboard.

## How to Resize a Block Storage Volume

Storage volumes **cannot** be sized down, only up. Keep this in mind when sizing your volumes.

1.  Shut down your Linode.

2.  Click the **Edit** option for the volume you want to resize.

3.  Enter the new volume size. The minimum size is 10 GiB and maximum is 10,000 GiB. Then click **Save Changes**.

    [![Linode Manager edit volume](/docs/assets/bs-resize-volume-small.png)](/docs/assets/bs-resize-volume.png)

4.  You'll be returned to the volume list and the **Status** column for the volume should say **resizing**.

    [![Linode Manager edit volume](/docs/assets/bs-volume-resizing-small.png)](/docs/assets/bs-volume-resizing.png)

5.  Reboot your Linode and your volume resize will be completed.
