Use the *My Profile* page to modify the email address associated with your user account. The email address saved on this webpage receives IP whitelist warnings, password reset messages, and support tickets for services that you have permission to access. You may also receive invoices and receipts, if the primary account holder grants you access to that information.

Here's how to change your email address on the *My Profile* webpage:

1.  Select the **My Profile** link by clicking on your username at the top of the page.

    {{< image src="accounts-select-my-profile.png" alt="Select 'My Profile' in the Linode Cloud Manager" title="Select 'My Profile' in the Linode Cloud Manager" >}}

1.  In the **Display** tab, enter your email address in the **Email** field.

    {{< image src="accounts-my-profile-change-email.png" alt="Modify the email address associated with your user account" title="Modify the email address associated with your user account" >}}

1.  Click **Save**.

Your profile's email account will be updated.
