Did you forget your Cloud Manager username? Recover it with the *Forgot Username* webpage. Here's how:

1.  Visit the [Forgot Username](https://login.linode.com/forgot/username) webpage.
1.  Enter your email address in the **Email** field.
1.  Click **Submit**.

In a couple minutes, you'll receive an email message with any Linode Cloud Manager users that correspond to that email. If you do not receive information about any users, then you may have registered your account with a different email.
