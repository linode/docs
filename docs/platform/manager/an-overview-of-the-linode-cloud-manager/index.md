The [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) provides a user-friendly interface to manage your infrastructure, user accounts, billing and payments, and to open and track support tickets. You can easily create Linode instances, managed Kubernetes clusters, add backups to your Linodes, deploy One-Click Apps, track event notifications, create Object Storage buckets, and more. The Cloud Manager is implemented solely atop our [public APIv4](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4), which gives you access to all our latest products and services.

## In this Guide

This guide provides an overview of the features and services available in Linode's Cloud Manager. Some of the topics that will be discussed are:

- An introduction to each section of the Cloud Manager, including links to related guides throughout our documentation library.
- The location of commonly used Cloud Manager features.
- Settings that might make your overall Cloud Manager experience better

### Zone Files

The Cloud Manager automatically ensures that your Domain's zone file does not contain any errors when a Domain Record is created or updated.

{{< note >}}
This Cloud Manager and [API v4](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4) functionality is currently under active development.
{{</ note >}}

- When creating a Zone File for a Domain, the [Linode API v4](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4) checks for any errors that may exist. If an error is found, the Cloud Manager will respond with the corresponding error. This means that the Cloud Manager will not allow you to create an invalid zone file.

- Once your Domain and corresponding Zone File is created, you can use the `dig` command to further verify that each domain record contains the information you expect. It will take a few moments before a newly created domain record will show up when issuing the `dig` command.

        dig example.com
        dig example.com MX

    See the [Use dig to Perform Manual DNS Queries](/docs/networking/dns/use-dig-to-perform-manual-dns-queries/) guide for more details on the `dig` command.

### Password Management

The Cloud Manager does not support forcing password expirations. Forcing password resets on a schedule is [bad practice from a security perspective](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05). Current security research indicates that forced password changes do more harm than good. If you want to force password resets for users of your Linode account, we recommend using a password manager for this purpose.

## Tags

Linode’s Cloud Manager and [API v4](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4) allow you to create tags to help organize and group your Linode resources. Tags can be applied to [Linodes](#linodes), [Block Storage Volumes](#volumes), [NodeBalancers](#nodebalancers), and [Domains](#domains-dns-manager). See the [Tags and Groups](/docs/quick-answers/linode-platform/tags-and-groups/) guide to learn how to create, apply, and search for tags.

## Events and Activity Feeds

Tasks performed using the Linode Cloud Manager or other account specific tools like Linode’s [CLI](/docs/platform/api/linode-cli/) or [API](https://www.linode.com/products/api/) will be logged to an individual Linode’s activity feed, or on your account’s [Events Page](https://cloud.linode.com/events). The events and activity pages are user accessible logs, or histories of events taking place on your account. They contain details regarding the most notable events affecting your Linodes, like reboots, shutdowns, migrations, and more.

For more details, see the [Understanding the Cloud Manager Events and Activity Feeds](/docs/platform/manager/what-are-the-cloud-manager-events-and-activity-feeds/) guide.

## User Interface Enhancements

### Compact Mode and Dark Mode
Cloud Manager provides three different UI themes that you can toggle on and off depending on your preference. By default, **Normal** mode will be selected. You can also choose **Compact Mode** which compresses any extra screen space and allows more information to be displayed on the screen. This setting is located at the bottom left hand corner of the screen when the gear icon is clicked. This is also where you can toggle on *Dark Mode*, which changes your UI's color scheme. **Light** mode is selected by default.

### Accessibility

The Linode Cloud Manager has been built with accessibility in mind. Currently, the Cloud Manager is actively being developed to achieve [WCAG 2.0 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

We have received a lot of helpful feedback from our users regarding accessibility. While we have addressed a lot of your feedback, this is still a work in progress and will be iterated upon with time. Please contact feedback@linode.com with any comments or requests regarding accessibility.
