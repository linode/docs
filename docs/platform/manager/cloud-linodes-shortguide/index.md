The Linodes section of Cloud Manager allows you to create and manage your Linodes. Each Linode instance in Cloud Manager includes:

- [Summary information](/docs/uptime/monitoring-and-maintaining-your-server/#linode-cloud-manager) about your Linode, like CPU usage, IPv4 and [IPv6 traffic](/docs/networking/an-overview-of-ipv6-on-linode/), and Disk IO
- Access to any of your Linode's attached Volumes and the ability to [create a Volume](/docs/platform/block-storage/how-to-use-block-storage-with-your-linode/#add-a-volume-from-the-linode-detail-page)
- Networking information and features, including the ability to add IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, [IP transfer](/docs/platform/manager/remote-access/#transferring-ip-addresses) and [IP sharing](/docs/platform/manager/remote-access/#configuring-ip-sharing)
- The ability to [resize your Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/), boot your Linode into [Rescue Mode](/docs/troubleshooting/rescue-and-rebuild/#rescue-mode-overview), and [rebuild your Linode](/docs/troubleshooting/rescue-and-rebuild/#rebuilding)
- Access to Linode's [Backup service](/docs/platform/disk-images/linode-backup-service/#enable-the-backup-service)
- An [Activity Feed](/docs/platform/manager/what-are-the-cloud-manager-events-and-activity-feeds) that displays any relevant events related to this Linode
- Settings that allow you to update your Linode's label, [reset your Linode's root password](/docs/quick-answers/linode-platform/reset-the-root-password-on-your-linode/), [manage system usage email notifications](/docs/uptime/monitoring-and-maintaining-your-server/#configure-linode-cloud-manager-email-alerts), [manage Watchdog](/docs/uptime/monitoring-and-maintaining-your-server/#configure-shutdown-watchdog) (Linode's automatic reboot feature), and delete your Linode
- An area to [manage and create disks and configuration profiles](/docs/platform/disk-images/disk-images-and-configuration-profiles/)
