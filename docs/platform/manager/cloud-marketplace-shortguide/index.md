The **Marketplace** section of Cloud Manager gives you access to apps that make it easy to deploy and configure One-Click Apps on a Linode. Some popular One-Click Apps are [WordPress](/docs/platform/one-click/deploying-wordpress-with-one-click-apps/), [Minecraft](/docs/platform/one-click/deploying-minecraft-with-one-click-apps/), and [GitLab](/docs/platform/one-click/deploy-gitlab-with-one-click-apps/). We are actively adding new and useful One-Click apps. When a One-Click App is deployed, a new Linode is created and the appropriate software is installed with the configurations you provide.

See [How to Use Linode's One-Click Apps](/docs/platform/one-click/how-to-use-one-click-apps-at-linode/) to get started using One-Click Apps in Cloud Manager.
