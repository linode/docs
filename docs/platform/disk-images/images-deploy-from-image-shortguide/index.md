Deploying one of your saved images to any Linode under your account is a simple process.

1.  Navigate to the **Images** page, click on the **more options ellipsis** to open the menu for the Image from which you would like to deploy, and select **Deploy New Linode**.

1.  Select your Image from *My Images* under the *Create from Image* tab.

    {{< caution >}}
You cannot deploy an image that was created from a RAW disk format. Attempting to do so will result in a failure.
{{< /caution >}}

1.  Select your desired Region, Linode Plan, Label, and set your root password, then click **Create** to create a Linode with your saved image.

Once you've completed these steps, your saved image will be deployed on your new Linode.
