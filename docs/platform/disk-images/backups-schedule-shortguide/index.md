You can configure when automatic backups are initiated. Here's how:

1.  From the **Linodes** page, select the Linode.

1.  Click the **Backups** tab.

1.  Under **Settings**, select a time interval from the **Time of Day** menu. The Linode Backup Service will generate all backups between these hours.

1.  Select a day from the **Day of Week** menu. This is the day whose backup will be promoted to the weekly slot. The back up will be performed within the time period you specified in step 3.

1.  Click **Save Changes**.

The Linode Backup Service will backup your Linode according to the schedule you specified.
