## Clone Your Linode

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).
2.  Select the **Linodes** tab to list your active Linodes.
3.  Click on the Linode you wish to clone. This will load its Dashboard.
4.  **Recommended:** Click **Shut down** to power down the Linode. This is recommended to prevent data corruption.
5.  Click the **Clone** tab to select the disks or configuration profiles you wish to clone. If you select a configuration profile, all of the disks attached to it will be included automatically. You can confirm this from the *Disks Attached* column.

6.  Once you've applied your choices, hit **Select**. You'll be provided with an approximate estimate of how long it will take to clone your Linode:

7.  From the **Destination Linode** menu, select the Linode you want to clone to.
8.  Click **Clone**. The receiving Linode's Dashboard will appear. Watch the *Host Job Queue* to monitor your progress.

Once the cloning process completes, your selected disks and configuration profiles will be available on the destination Linode.
