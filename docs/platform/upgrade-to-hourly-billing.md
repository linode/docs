This guide will show you how to upgrade your prepaid Linode account to use Hourly billing. For more information on Hourly billing, see our [Billing Guide](/docs/platform/billing-and-payments).

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the Hourly billing system, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](http://manager.linode.com).
2.  Click the **Account** tab.
3.  From the **Account** tab, select the **Convert to Hourly billing** link in the lower right.

    [![Select the Convert to Hourly billing link towards the end of the page.](/docs/assets/convert-to-hourly-account-tab-small.png)](/docs/assets/convert-to-hourly-account-tab.png)

4.  You'll be taken to a page with a brief overview of the Hourly billing system. If you have any prepaid amounts on your account from the current month or year, you will receive that amount as a credit on your account to be used toward future invoices. Click the **Convert me to Hourly NOW!** button to finalize the conversion.

5.  You will receive a confirmation message that your account has been converted to Hourly billing.

    {{< note >}}
- Prepaid discounts will not carry over to the new system
    - Those who remain on the prepaid billing system will not experience any changes, however newer plans and services may not be available on prepaid accounts.

## Possible Notices

When you select the **Convert to Hourly billing** link in Step 3 above, you may receive an error or notice. For example, this account has several notices that **This package needs to be paid**:

[![You may receive some notices that "This package needs to be paid."](/docs/assets/1616-metered_errors_cropped_sm.png)](/docs/assets/1617-metered_errors_cropped.png)

To resolve unpaid packages, you can:

-   Check for unpaid invoices, and attempt to pay them immediately. Use the **click to charge** link on the main **Account** tab
-   Check for **extras** packages, and [remove](/docs/platform/billing-and-payments#removing-services) them manually
-   [Contact support](/docs/support) for other notices on this page

You will no longer receive the annual discount when you switch to Hourly billing. If you have a discounted package on your account, you will receive this notice:

[![Please note the annual discounts will go away when converting to Hourly.](/docs/assets/convert-to-hourly-annual-small.png)](/docs/assets/convert-to-hourly-annual.png)

If you want to stay on the old billing system, just don't click the final button.
