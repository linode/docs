## OpenVPN One-Click App

OpenVPN is a widely trusted, free, and open-source VPN (virtual private network) application that creates encrypted tunnels for secure data transfer between computers that are not on the same local network. Your traffic is encrypted by OpenVPN using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/). You can use OpenVPN to:

- Connect your computer to the public Internet through a dedicated OpenVPN server. By encrypting your traffic and routing it through an OpenVPN server that you control, you can protect yourself from network attacks when using public Wi-Fi.

- Connect your computer to services that you don't want to expose to the public Internet. Keep your sensitive applications isolated on your servers' private networking and use OpenVPN to access them remotely.

## Deploy OpenVPN with One-Click Apps

{{< content deploy-one-click-apps >}}

### OpenVPN Options

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **VPN Password** | The password you'll use when connecting to your VPN. *Required*. |

### Linode Options

After providing the app specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|--------------|------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by the OpenVPN One-Click App, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). You can use any size Linode for your OpenVPN App. The Linode plan that you select should be representative of the amount of data transfer and users you expect for your VPN. For personal usage, you can create your VPN on a Nanode or 2GB Linode and should see good performance, unless you are performing intensive data transfers across your VPN. If you decide that you need more or fewer hardware resources after you deploy your app, you can always [resize your Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/) to a different plan. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories: lowercase and uppercase case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **OpenVPN will take anywhere from 2-5 minutes to install after your Linode has provisioned**.

## Getting Started After Deployment

Your VPN's administrative web interface will be available via a web browser at `https://192.0.2.2:943/admin/`, where `192.0.2.2` represents the IPv4 address of your new Linode instance. Your IPv4 address can be found under the **Networking** tab on your new Linode's detail page.

The client web interface for your VPN is located at `https://192.02.2:943/`, where your Linode's IP address should take the place of the `192.0.2.2` example address. The client interface includes links to download the OpenVPN client software for your computer.

The username you should use to log in to your OpenVPN server is `openvpn`. The password for connecting to the VPN is the password you supplied in the One-Click App creation form.

### Open a Connection to your VPN

To open a connection to your OpenVPN server from your computer, you'll need to install the OpenVPN client software. Follow the instructions in the [Client Software Installation](/docs/networking/vpn/install-openvpn-access-server-on-linux/#client-software-installation) section of our [OpenVPN](/docs/networking/vpn/install-openvpn-access-server-on-linux/#client-software-installation) guide for a detailed explanation of how to install and use this software.

### Software Included

| **Software** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| [**OpenVPN Access Server**](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server/) | VPN server software. |
