## Minecraft One-Click App

With over 100 million users around the world, [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/) is the most popular online game of all time. You and other players are free to build and explore in a 3D generated world made up of millions of mineable blocks. Collect resources by leveling mountains, taming forests, and venturing out to sea. Choose a home from the varied list of biomes like ice worlds, flower plains, and jungles. Build ancient castles or modern mega cities, and fill them with redstone circuit contraptions and villagers. Fight off nightly invasions of Skeletons, Zombies, and explosive Creepers, or adventure to the End and the Nether to summon the fabled End Dragon and the chaotic Wither. If that is not enough, Minecraft is also highly moddable and customizable. You decide the rules when hosting your own Minecraft server for you and your friends to play together in this highly addictive game.

### Linode Options

After providing the app specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by Minecraft One-Click Apps, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). Your MineCraft App should be sized based on the amount of traffic you expect to see on your server. We recommend 1GB of RAM for every 15 players maximum on your server. For example, If you are expecting a small group of players (between 1-15), you should be okay with a Nanode. Up to 30 players, a 2GB Linode, and so on. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories: lowercase and uppercase case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **MineCraft should install between 5-10 minutes after your Linode has successfully provisioned**.

## Getting Started after Deployment

Ensure that you have [installed Minecraft](https://my.minecraft.net/store/minecraft/) on your personal computer and created a Minecraft user account before getting started with this section.

After Minecraft has finished installing on your Linode, you will be able to access your Minecraft server by copying your Linode's IPv4 address and entering it in the Multiplayer menu on your personal computer's Minecraft installation. To find your Linode's IPv4 address:

1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the sidebar. You will see a list of all your Linodes.

1. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

1. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

1. Under the **IPv4** heading, you will find your IPv4 address listed under the **Address** column. Copy your IPv4 address.

1. Open Minecraft on your computer and click on **Multiplayer**, then click **Add Server**.

1. Enter a name for your server in the **Server Name** box. This name will show up on the *Play Multiplayer* server selection screen.

1. Paste your IP address in the **Server Address** field and click **Done**:

    ![Paste your IP address in the Server Address field.](minecraft-one-click-edit-server-info.png)

1. Once your server is ready to play on, the status indicator will show a series of green bars.

    ![A Minecraft server that is ready to accept connections](minecraft-one-click-server-selection-screen.png)

    If there is a red *X* over the status bars, or it says *old*, then your Linode has not finished installing Minecraft. Wait a few minutes, then hit **Refresh**.
