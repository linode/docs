[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory, data-structure store, with the optional ability to write and persist data to a disk, which can be used as a key-value database, cache, and message broker. Redis features built-in transactions, replication, and support for a variety of data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and others.

### Linode Options

Provide configurations for your Linode server that will run your Redis installation:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by Redis One-Click Apps, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). Redis serves all data from memory, we recommend using a [high memory Linode plan](https://www.linode.com/products/high-memory/). Depending on the type of environment (development or production) that you plan to use, your system resources may vary. See [Redis' Hardware Requirements](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/designing-production/hardware-requirements/) for a detailed overview. You can always [resize your Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/) to a different plan later if you feel you need to increase or decrease your system resources. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Add Tags** | A tag to help organize and group your Linode resources. [Tags](/docs/quick-answers/linode-platform/tags-and-groups/) can be applied to Linodes, Block Storage Volumes, NodeBalancers, and Domains. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories: lowercase and uppercase case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your Redis app will complete installation anywhere between 2-5 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.

## Getting Started after Deployment

There are several types of Redis deployments you can use, for example, a standalone Redis installation or a Redis cluster with a master and two replicas. As a next step, you should determine which type of deployment you will need for your use case by reviewing the resources provided below.

-  Learn about Redis Clusters by going through their related [tutorial](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial).
- Redis Sentinel is another deployment configuration focused on high availability. See the [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) documentation for more details.
- Read the [Redis Quickstart](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart) to learn about securing Redis and installing client libraries to use Redis with your applications.
- Refer to the [Redis configuration documentation](https://redis.io/topics/config) to learn about the Redis configuration file.

Once you have determined how you would like to configure your Redis deployment, connect to your [Linode via SSH](/docs/getting-started/#connect-to-your-linode-via-ssh) to complete your configuration.
