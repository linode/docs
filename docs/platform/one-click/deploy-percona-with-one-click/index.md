## Percona PMM One-Click App

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free open-source tool which provides a GUI powered by [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for monitoring and managing MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. With PMM, you can easily observe important metrics, logging, and statistics related to the your databases. Additionally, it includes a number of tools which can optimize your database's performance, manage all database instances, and track and identify potential security threats.


### Deploy a GitLab One-Click App

### Linode Options

The following configuration options are possible for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|--------------|------------|
| **Hostname** | The [hostname](https://www.linode.com/docs/getting-started/#set-the-hostname) you'll use for the new Linode. |
| **Select an Image** | Debian and Ubuntu are currently the only images supported by the Percona PMM One-Click App. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). We recommend that you use, at minimum, an **@GB Linode plan** at minimum for your Percona PMM server. For more information on Percona's system requirements see their [official documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/faq.html#what-are-the-minimum-system-requirements-for-pmm). If you decide that you need more or fewer hardware resources after you deploy your app, you can always [resize your Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/) to a different plan. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories: lowercase and uppercase case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your Percona app will complete installation anywhere between 1-5 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your PPM Server

After the Percona PMM has finished installing, you will be able to access it over `http://` with your Linode's IPv4 address. To find your Linode's IPv4 address:

  1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the sidebar. You will see a list of all your Linodes.

  1. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

  1. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

  1. Your IPv4 address will be listed under the **Address** column in the **IPv4** table.

  1. Copy and paste the IPv4 address into a browser window. Ensure you are using `http://`.

1. On the following screen, you will see the PMM Home Dashboard actively monitoring your server:
