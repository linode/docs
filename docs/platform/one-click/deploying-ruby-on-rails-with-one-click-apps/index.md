## Ruby on Rails One-Click App

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is a server-side web application framework that allows web designers and developers to implement dynamic, fully featured web applications.

### Deploy a Ruby on Rails One-Click App

{{< content "deploy-one-click-apps">}}

The [Ruby on Rails Options](#ruby-on-rails-options) section of this guide provides details on all available configuration options for this app.

### Ruby on Rails Options

You can configure your Ruby on Rails App by providing values for the following fields:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Rails Application name** | The name for your rails application. *Required*. |

### Linode Options

After providing the app specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by Ruby on Rails One-Click Apps, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions).  *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your Ruby on Rails app will complete installation anywhere between 2-5 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access Ruby on Rails

After Ruby on Rails has finished installing, you will be able to access Ruby on Rails from the console via ssh with your Linode's IPv4 address:

1.  [SSH into your Linode](/docs/getting-started/#connect-to-your-linode-via-ssh) and [create a limited user account](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#add-a-limited-user-account).

1.  Log out and log back in as your limited user account.

1.  Update your server:

        sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

1.  Ruby comes with some pre-made scripts to get you started. One of these is a blog. To begin with the blog example, use the following command:

        rails new blog

    This creates a new Rails application called Blog in the `blog` directory.

1.  Move into the `blog` directory:

        cd blog

1.  Start the built in server with the following command, replacing the IP address with your Linode's IP address:

        rails server --binding=198.51.100.0

    {{< output >}}
Warning: Running `gem pristine --all` to regenerate your installed gemspecs (and deleting then reinstalling your bundle if you use bundle --path) will improve the startup performance of Spring.
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.7.1 application starting in development on http://198.51.100.0:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server

{{</ output >}}

1.  You can visit your application by visiting the address in the browser.

    ![Rails Welcome Page](rails-welcome-page.png "Rails Welcome Page")

1.  Exit the server process with **Ctrl+C**.

## Create a Controller and View

A controller will receive requests which are then routed and served by various actions. A view displays information.

1.  Create a controller called `Welcome` and an action called `index`:

        rails generate controller Welcome index

    {{< output >}}
create  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
route   get 'welcome/index'
invoke  erb
create    app/views/welcome
create    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
invoke  test_unit
create    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb
invoke  helper
create    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb
invoke    test_unit
invoke  assets
invoke    coffee
create      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.coffee
invoke    scss
create      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.scss
{{</ output >}}

1.  With the text editor of your choice, edit the file `app/views/welcome/index.html.erb` and replace the contents with the following:

    {{< file "app/views/welcome/index.html.erb" html >}}
<h1>Hello, World! This is Ruby on Rails!</h1>
{{</ file >}}

1.  Tell Rails where to find the document root. Edit the file `config/routes.rb`, find and uncomment the line root as shown:

    {{< file "config/routes" conf >}}
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

...

  root 'welcome#index'

...
end
{{</ file >}}

1.  Start the server again:

        rails server --binding=198.51.100.0

    You should see your new welcome page in the web browser.

For more information on setting up a more substantial application, refer to the [Ruby on Rails Getting Started Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
