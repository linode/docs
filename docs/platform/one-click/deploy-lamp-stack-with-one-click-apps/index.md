## LAMP Stack One-Click App

A LAMP (Linux, [Apache](https://www.apache.org), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com), [PHP](https://www.php.net)) stack is a popular, free, and open-source web software bundle used for hosting websites on Linux. This software environment is a foundation for popular PHP application frameworks like WordPress, Drupal, and Laravel. After you deploy your LAMP One-Click App, you can upload your existing PHP application code to it or use a PHP framework to write a new application on your Linode.

### Deploy a LAMP Stack with One-Click Apps

{{< content "deploy-one-click-apps" >}}

The [LAMP Stack Options](#lamp-stack-options) section of this guide provides details on all available configuration options for this app.

### LAMP Stack Options

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MySQL Root Password** | The root password for your LAMP stack's MySQL database. This is not the same as your Linode's root password. *Required*. |

### Linode Options

After providing the app-specific options, enter configuration values for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by the LAMP One-Click App, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). The Linode plan you deploy your LAMP stack on should account for the estimated workload. If you are standing up a simple web page, you can use a Nanode or 2GB Linode. If you are standing up a larger or more robust web app, then consider a plan with higher RAM and CPU allocations. If you decide that you need more or fewer hardware resources after you deploy your app, you can always [resize your Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/) to a different plan. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories: lowercase and uppercase case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your LAMP Stack app will complete installation anywhere between 2-3 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning.**

### Getting Started After Deployment

After your LAMP stack has finished deploying, you can:

- [Connect to your Linode via SSH](/docs/getting-started/#connect-to-your-linode-via-ssh). You will need your Linode's root password to proceed. Note that your Linode's web root will be located in the `/var/www/html` directory.

- [Navigate to the public IP address](/docs/getting-started/#find-your-linode-s-ip-address) of your Linode in a browser. You will see the PHP settings that are active for your Linode.

- Consult the following guides to learn more about working with the various components of the LAMP stack:

    - [Secure HTTP Traffic with Certbot](https://linode.com/docs/quick-answers/websites/secure-http-traffic-certbot/)
    - [Apache Configuration Basics](/docs/web-servers/apache-tips-and-tricks/apache-configuration-basics/)
    - [How to Optimize MySQL Performance Using MySQLTuner](/docs/databases/mysql/how-to-optimize-mysql-performance-using-mysqltuner/)

-   Upload files to your web root directory with an SFTP application like [FileZilla](/docs/tools-reference/file-transfer/filezilla/). Use the same root credentials that you would use for SSH.

-   Assign a domain name to your Linode's IP address. Review the [DNS Manager](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on setting up your DNS records in the Cloud Manager, and read through [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/) for general information about how DNS works.

### Software Included

The LAMP Stack One-Click App will install the following software on your Linode:

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| [**Apache HTTP Server**](https://www.apache.org) | Web server that can be used to serve your site or web application.|
| [**MySQL Server**](https://www.mysql.com) | Relational database. |
| [**PHP 7**](https://www.php.net) | General purpose programming language. |
| [**UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall) | Firewall utility. Ports 22/tcp, 80/tcp, and 443/tcp for IPv4 and IPv6 will allow outgoing and incoming traffic. |
