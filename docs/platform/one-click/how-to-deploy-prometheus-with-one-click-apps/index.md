Gain metrics and receive alerts with this open-source monitoring tool.
Prometheus is a powerful monitoring software tool that collects metrics from configurable data points at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed.

## Deploy Prometheus with One-Click Apps

{{< content deploy-one-click-apps >}}

### Linode Options

After providing the app-specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by the WireGuard One-Click App, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required* |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). You can use any size Linode for your WireGuard App. The Linode plan that you select should be appropriate for the amount of data transfer, users, and other stress that may affect the performance of your VPN. You can create your VPN on a Nanode 1GB or a Linode 2GB with low risk for performance hits, unless you expect intensive data transfer to happen on your VPN. *Required* |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Manager’s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Add Tags** | A tag to help organize and group your Linode resources. [Tags](/docs/quick-answers/linode-platform/tags-and-groups/) can be applied to Linodes, Block Storage Volumes, NodeBalancers, and Domains. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories: lowercase and uppercase case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required* |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your Prometheus app will complete installation anywhere between 2-5 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.
