## Drupal One-Click App

Drupal is a content management system (CMS) designed for building custom websites for personal and business use. Built for high performance and scalability, Drupal provides the necessary tools to create rich, interactive "community" websites with forums, user blogs, and private messaging. Drupal also has support for personal publishing projects and can power podcasts, blogs, and knowledge-based systems, all within a single, unified platform.

In addition to the core infrastructure, there are a number of freely available Drupal modules that allow administrators of Drupal sites to provide additional functionality, and a robust API makes it easy to enable these features. Furthermore, Drupal has an advanced theming engine that allows for a great amount of flexibility for displaying content.

### Deploy a Drupal One-Click App

{{< content "deploy-one-click-apps">}}

The [Drupal Options](#drupal-options) section of this guide provides details on all available configuration options for this app.

### Drupal Options

You can configure your Drupal App by providing values for the following fields:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Drupal admin password** | Password for your Drupal admin profile. *Required*. |
| **Drupal admin username** | Username for your Drupal admin user. *Required*. |
| **E-Mail for your Drupal account** | E-Mail address for your Drupal admin user. *Required*. |
| **Your SSH public key** | Your SSH public key. *Advanced Configuration*. |
| **Domain** | Domain for your Drupal site. Setting a value in this field will not also enable DNS for your app, which you should do as well. Read our [DNS Manager](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on creating DNS records in the Linode Cloud Manager. *Advanced Configuration*. |

### Linode Options

After providing the app specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by Drupal One-Click Apps, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). Drupal is an extremely flexible CMS that can be supported on any size Linode, but we suggest you deploy your Drupal app on a Linode plan that reflects how much content you plan on featuring as well as how much traffic you expect for your site. For small websites, a 1GB Nanode is sufficient. If you decide that you need more or fewer hardware resources after you deploy your app, you can always [resize your Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/) to a different plan. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories: lowercase and uppercase case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your Drupal app will complete installation anywhere between 2-5 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Drupal Site

After Drupal has finished installing, you will be able to access your Drupal site over `http://` with your Linode's IPv4 address, or the domain name entered when deploying your One-Click App:

1.  Access your Drupal site:

    **With your Linode's IP Address**

    You will be able to access your Drupal site by copying your Linode's IPv4 address and entering it in the browser of your choice. To find your Linode's IPv4 address:

    1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the sidebar. You will see a list of all your Linodes.

    1. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

    1. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

    1. The IP address will be displayed under the **Address** column in the **IPv4** table.

    1. Copy and paste the IPv4 address into a browser window. You should see the Drupal welcome page appear.

    **With a Domain Name**

    If you deployed your Drupal One-Click App with a domain name and it is pointing to the Linode's IP address that is hosting your Drupal instance, then you can enter the domain name in a browser window to access your Drupal site. Ensure you are using `http://`.

    For more details on registering your domain, see the [DNS Manager](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/) guide.

1.  Once you have accessed your Drupal site via the browser, you can log in using the admin credentials you created when deploying your app. Then, begin configuring your site.
