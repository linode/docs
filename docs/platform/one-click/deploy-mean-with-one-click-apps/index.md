## MERN One-Click App

A MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack is a free and open-source web software bundle used to build modern web applications:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document database used to persist your application's data.

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) serves as the web application framework.

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) is used to build your application's user interfaces using JavaScript. Angular offers Web Workers and server-side rendering that helps your applications achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) serves as the run-time environment for your application.

 MEAN is a full-stack JavaScript-based framework consisting of MongoDB database, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS. You can build entire web applications on JavaScript, from client to server to database with this stack. Single-language programming makes it easier to develop working applications more quickly without sacrificing functionality and features.

### Deploy a MEAN One-Click App

{{< content deploy-one-click-apps>}}


### Linode Options

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by the MEAN One-Click App, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). The Linode plan you deploy your MEAN stack on should account for the estimated workload. If you are standing up a simple web page, you can use a Nanode or 2GB Linode. If you will deploy a more robust web app, then consider a plan with higher RAM and CPU allocations. If you decide that you need more or fewer hardware resources after you deploy your app, you can always [resize your Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/) to a different plan. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories: lowercase and uppercase case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |


### Getting Started After Deployment

After your MEAN One-click App has finished installing, you can:

- [Connect to your Linode via SSH](/docs/getting-started/#connect-to-your-linode-via-ssh). You will need your Linode's root password to proceed.


### Software Included

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MongoDB** | Document-based database |
| **Express** | Web application framework |
| **Angular** | JavaScript library |
| **Node JS** | Runtime environment |
| **UFW (UncomplicatedFirewall)** | Firewall utility. Ports 22/tcp for IPv4 and IPv6 will allow incoming traffic. All other ports will have the following firewall rules: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing). |
