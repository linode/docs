## Jitsi One-Click App

[Jitsi](https://jitsi.org) is a suite of open source projects that allows you to host your own virtual video conferences.

## Deploy Jitsi with One-Click Apps

{{< content deploy-one-click-apps >}}

### Jitsi Options

The Jitsi One-Click form includes advanced fields to setup your Jitsi server's domain records and a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. These are optional configurations and are not required for installation.

{{< note >}}
To use Jitsi with encrypted connections, you need an SSL certificate. If you choose to create the free SSL certificate during setup, you must have a fully qualified domain name registered prior to installation.

If Jitsi is not created with the SSL option enabled, it will use a self-signed certificate which may trigger an `invalid certificate` response in some browsers.
{{</ note >}}

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **The hostname for your server** | The [hostname](/docs/getting-started/#set-the-hostname) for the server. The default value "meet" is filled in when you select Jitsi from the Marketplace Apps; feel free to change this. |
| **Your domain** | The domain name where you wish to host your Jitsi server. For example, `example.com`. |
| **Your Linode API Token.** | Your Linode API access token is needed to create your DNS records and to create the Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. If you don't have a token, you must [create one](/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token) before continuing. |
| **Would you like to use a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate?** | Select `Yes` if you would like the install to create an SSL certificate for you, or `No` if you do not. You cannot create secure, encrypted conferences without an SSL certificate. If `No` is selected, the Jitsi app will trigger security warnings in most web browsers. |
| **Admin Email for Let's Encrypt certificate** | The email you wish to use for the SSL certificate. This email address will receive notifications when the certificate needs to be renewed. |

{{< note >}}
The address to access Jitsi will be `hostname`.`domain name`. For example, if you kept the default hostname, `meet`, and your domain name is `example.com`, to access Jitsi, the address is: `https://meet.example.com`.
{{</ note >}}

### Linode Options

After providing the app-specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Select an Image** | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is currently the only image supported by Jitsi One-Click Apps, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required* |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). The Linode plan that you select should be appropriate for the amount of data transfer, users, and other stress that may affect the performance of your server. We recommend you create at least a Linode 8GB. If you are going to be hosting large meetings, or many simultaneous meetings, consider a larger and/or dedicated plan. *Required* |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required* |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your Jitsi app will complete installation anywhere between 3-5 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.

## Getting Started After Deployment

Jitsi is now installed and ready to use.

1.  Before you go to your app, if you filled out the optional Jitsi configuration fields:

    - In the Cloud Manager [DNS Manager](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/#add-a-domain) there is now an entry for your domain with two `A/AAAA` records pointing to your new server. One for the domain name and one for the hostname.
    - [Configure the rDNS](/docs/networking/dns/configure-your-linode-for-reverse-dns/) on your Linode.

1.  If you didn't setup a domain, navigate to the IP address of the Linode in your browser. You can find the IP address for your Linode on the Linode detail page in the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com). If you did setup a domain, navigate to the address as described in the [Jitsi Options](#jitsi-options) section above.

1.  Jitsi prompts you to start a meeting.
