{{< caution >}}
Object Storage is similar to a subscription service. **Once enabled, you will be billed at the flat rate regardless of whether or not there are active buckets on your account.** You must [Cancel Object Storage](/docs/platform/object-storage/how-to-use-object-storage/#cancel-object-storage) to stop billing for this service.
