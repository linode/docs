1.  Log into the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

3.  Enter a label for the key pair. This label is how you reference the key pair in the Linode Cloud Manager. Then, click **Submit**.

4.  A window appears that contains the access key and the secret key. Write these down somewhere secure. The access key is visible in the Linode Cloud Manager, but **you can not retrieve the secret key again after you close the window!**

    You now have the credentials needed to connect to Linode Object Storage.
