## Value Added Tax in the European Union

Linode customers who are subject to EU VAT can [review these charges](#review-your-charges) on their monthly invoices by navigating to the **Account** page in the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

Customers that wish to provide Linode with a valid VAT identification number (VAT ID) may do so by [updating their contact information](#adding-an-eu-vat-id-to-your-linode-account). Such customers will not be charged with EU VAT in subsequent invoices once their VAT ID is verified. You can also specify a VAT ID in our account signup form when you first create your Linode account.

{{< note >}}
Information about your EU VAT rate can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat_en). Please note, Linode’s [pricing plans](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/billing-and-payments/#linode-cloud-hosting-and-backups) do **NOT** include EU VAT charges.

## Adding an EU VAT ID to your Linode Account

Valid VAT IDs may be added to your account via the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) or the [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli).

If you are using the Linode Classic Manager, review the [classic manager version of this guide](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/tax-information-classic-manager/#adding-an-eu-vat-id-to-your-linode-account) for alternative instructions.

## FAQ

-   **How is my tax location determined?**

    Your tax location is determined by the contact information you provided during sign up or under the **Account** page in the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

-   **How can I change my tax location?**

    You may update your tax location by navigating to the **Account** page in the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) and expanding the **Update Contact Information** panel.

-   **Why is my invoice in USD? Can I get an invoice in another currency?**

    To keep our pricing stable and consistent, rather than fluctuating with exchange rates, we do not bill in local currency. Similarly, we do not invoice in local currency. All invoices are in USD.
