title: How Linode Billing Works
---

We've done our best to create straightforward billing and payment policies. Still have questions? Use this guide to learn how our hourly billing works and how to make payments, update your billing information, get referral credits, and remove services. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please feel free to [contact support](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/support/).

## How Hourly Billing Works

All services are billed automatically at the end of the month. If you used a service for the entirety of the past month, you'll be billed the **monthly cap** amount for that service. If you used a service for only part of the past month, you'll be billed at the **hourly** rate for that service. If your usage during any given month hits the monthly cap for the service, hourly billing stops. You'll never be billed more than the monthly cap for any service, excluding network [transfer overages](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/network-transfer-quota/#how-overages-work). In other words, if you've used a service for the entire month, you'll have a predictable amount on your bill.

## Mid-Month Billing

You may receive a mid-month bill from Linode if you reach a certain threshold of Linode services used within a single month. For many users, this amount will be **$50.00**, although your account history with Linode can adjust that amount. In general, a history of on-time payments to Linode will increase the threshold amount.

What does a mid-month bill mean? Your existing active services will stay active. However, you must pay the mid-month bill before you can activate additional Linode services. Once your payment is processed, you may continue adding new services.

## Payment Methods

We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. We also accept PayPal, as well as checks and money orders (which *must* be in USD) made out to "Linode, LLC" and sent to our [office](http://www.linode.com/contact). Please [contact support](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/support/) before paying with check or money order. Note that we do not accept bank/wire transfers.

<!-- The following video will show you how to make a payment via PayPal:

{{< note >}}
PayPal payments can only be made **after** an account is opened with an initial payment from a credit or debit card.

If you overpay, credit will be applied to your account; this allows you to prepay if desired. Service credit is always used before charging the credit card on file for ongoing service.

## Linode Cloud Hosting and Backups

Full specs of each plan can be found on our [pricing page](https://www.linode.com/pricing)

{{< note >}}
A large base amount of network transfer is included with all Linode plans, but exceeding that amount can result in a [transfer overage](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/network-transfer-quota/#how-overages-work) charge beyond the monthly cap.

Due to the [impending exhaustion of the IPv4 address space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion), Linode requires users to provide technical justification. To add another public IP address, please [contact support](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/support/) with your justification.

## If My Linode is Powered Off, Will I Be Billed?

**If your Linode is powered off you will still be billed for it.** Linode maintains your saved data and reserves your ability to use other resources like RAM and network capacity, even when your Linode is powered off. You will also be billed for any other active Linode service, such as Longview Pro or extra IP addresses.

If you want to stop being billed for a particular Linode service, you need to [remove](#removing-services) it from your account entirely.

## Referral Credits

You can receive service credit by referring new users to Linode. When you refer someone who maintains at least one active Linode for 90 days, your account will be issued a $20 service credit. Here's how to find your account referral code and URL:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select the **My Profile** link by clicking on your username at the top of the page.
1.  Select the **Referrals** tab.
1.  The referral code and URL are listed under the **Referrals** section. You can provide the code to friends and use the URL on your website to generate referrals.

Referral service credits must be used to purchase Linode services, and cannot be refunded as cash.

## Tax Information

Review our [Tax Information](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/tax-information/) guide for information about which taxes Linode may charge.
