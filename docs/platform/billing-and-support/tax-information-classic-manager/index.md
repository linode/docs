## Which Taxes are Collected by Linode?

Linode collects the European Union's Value Added Tax (VAT) for customers that are subject to it. Starting on September 1st, 2019, Linode will also collect Australia and India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) for customers in those countries.

The taxes that Linode collects will appear on your invoices, and you can [review these charges](#review-your-charges) by navigating to the **Account** tab in the [Linode Classic Manager](https://manager.linode.com).

{{< note >}}
Information about your EU VAT rate can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat_en). Please note, Linodeâ€™s [pricing plans](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/billing-and-payments/#linode-cloud-hosting-and-backups) do **NOT** include EU VAT charges.

## What Should I Do If My Services are Non-Taxable?

If you are a registered business, you may choose to provide Linode with a valid VAT identification number (VAT ID) or GST identification number (GST ID). Such customers will not be charged with VAT or GST in subsequent invoices once their VAT or GST ID is verified.

{{< note >}}
For the remainder of this guide, your VAT or GST ID will be referred to as your *tax ID*.
{{< /note >}}

You can [update your contact information](#add-a-tax-id-to-your-linode-account) at any time to apply your tax ID to your Linode account. You can also specify a tax ID in our account signup form when you first create your Linode account.

{{< note >}}
If you have documents which state that your organization's services with Linode should not be taxed, please [contact Linode Support](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/support-classic-manager/#contacting-linode-support).
