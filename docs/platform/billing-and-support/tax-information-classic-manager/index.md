## Value Added Tax in the European Union

Linode customers who are subject to EU VAT can [review these charges](#review-your-charges) on their monthly invoices by navigating to the **Account** tab in the [Linode Classic Manager](https://manager.linode.com).

Customers that wish to provide Linode with a valid VAT identification number (VAT ID) may do so by [updating their contact information](#adding-an-eu-vat-id-to-your-linode-account). Such customers will not be charged with EU VAT in subsequent invoices once their VAT ID is verified. You can also specify a VAT ID in our account signup form when you first create your Linode account.

{{< note >}}
Information about your EU VAT rate can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat_en). Please note, Linodeâ€™s [pricing plans](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/billing-and-payments/#linode-cloud-hosting-and-backups) do **NOT** include EU VAT charges.

## FAQ

-   **How is my tax location determined?**

    Your tax location is determined by the contact information you provided during sign up or under the **Account** tab in the [Linode Classic Manager](https://manager.linode.com).

-   **How can I change my tax location?**

    You may update your tax location by navigating to the **Account** tab in the [Linode Classic Manager](https://manager.linode.com) and then to the **Contact Info** tab that appears.

-   **Why is my invoice in USD? Can I get an invoice in another currency?**

    To keep our pricing stable and consistent, rather than fluctuating with exchange rates, we do not bill in local currency. Similarly, we do not invoice in local currency. All invoices are in USD.
