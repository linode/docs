## What is the European Union Value Added Tax?

The European Union and its member states (EU) impose a value added tax (VAT) on the sale of certain electronically supplied goods and services within the European Economic Area. Linode customers who are subject to EU VAT can [review these charges](#review-your-charges) on their monthly invoices or by navigating to the **Account** page in the [Linode Classic Manager](https://manager.linode.com).

Customers that wish to provide Linode with a valid VAT identification number (VAT ID) may do so by [updating their contact information](#adding-an-eu-vat-id-to-your-linode-account). Such customers will not be charged with EU VAT in subsequent invoices once their VAT ID is verified.

## Summary of EU VAT Rates

The table below lists the VAT rates as of January 1, 2015 for residents of respective countries.
