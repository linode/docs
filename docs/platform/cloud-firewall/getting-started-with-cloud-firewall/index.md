## What is Linode Cloud Firewall?

{{< note >}}
Cloud Firewall is now in beta, sign up through the [Linode Green Light program](https://www.linode.com/green-light/#sign-up-form) to test this feature before it's generally available. For more information visit the [Cloud Firewall](https://www.linode.com/products/firewall/) product page.
{{</ note >}}

Linode Cloud Firewall is a free service used to create, configure, and add stateful network-based firewalls to Linode services using the Linode Cloud Manager and the Linode APIv4. A Cloud Firewall is independent of the service it is attached to, so you can apply a single Firewall to multiple Linode services.

### Features

A Cloud Firewall analyzes traffic against a set of predefined rules at the network layer and determines if the traffic is permitted to communicate with the Linode Service it secures. Cloud Firewalls work as an allowlist with an implicit deny rule-- it blocks all traffic by default and only pass through network traffic that meets the parameters of the configured rules. If there are no outbound rules set, all outbound traffic is permitted.

### Limitations

- Currently, a Cloud Firewall can only be applied to Linodes.
- You can apply up to three Cloud Firewalls per Linode service.

### Inbound and Outbound Rules

A Cloud Firewall can be configured with *Inbound* and *Outbound* rules. Inbound rules limit incoming network connections to a Linode service based on the port(s) and sources you configure. Outbound rules limit the outgoing network connections coming from a Linode service based on the port(s) and destinations you configure.

### Predefined Rules

The Linode Cloud Manager provides a list of *predefined rules* that you can add to your Cloud Firewall. The predefined rules support common networking use cases and provide an easy foundation to get started with Cloud Firewalls. Since you can edit any rule applied to a Cloud Firewall you can use the predefined rules as a foundation and further [edit their configurations](#edit-cloud-firewall-rules) and also [add new custom rules](#add-new-cloud-firewall-rules) to your Firewall.

## Add a Cloud Firewall

1. Log into your [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) and select **Firewalls** from the navigation menu.

    ![Access the Firewalls listing page.](access-firewalls-listing.png)

1. From the **Firewalls** listing page, click on the **Add a Firewall** link.

    ![Click on the Add a Firewall link.](add-a-firewall.png)

1. The **Add a Firewall** drawer appears with the Firewall configurations needed to add a Firewall. Configure your Firewall with at minimum the required fields:

    | **Configuration** | **Description** |
    | :---------------: | :---------------: |
    | **Label** | The label is used an identifier for this Cloud Firewall. *Required*|
    | **Linodes**| The Linode(s) on which to apply this Firewall. A list of all Linodes on your account are visible. You can skip this configuration if you do not yet wish to apply the Firewall to a Linode. |

1. Click on the **Create** button. This creates the Cloud Firewall and it appears on the **Firewalls** listing page. By default, the Firewall has two Inbound rules applied to it; one for DNS queries (port `53`) and a second for SSH connections (port `22`). You can [edit](#edit-cloud-firewall-rules) or [delete](#delete-cloud-firewall-rules) the rules after adding the Firewall, if needed.

## Assign a Cloud Firewall to a Linode Service

1. Log into your [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) and select **Firewalls** from the navigation menu.

    ![Access the Firewalls listing page.](access-firewalls-listing.png)

1. From the **Firewalls** listing page, click on the Firewall that you would like to attach to a Linode. This takes you to the Firewall's **Rules** page.

1. Click on the **Linodes** tab. This takes you to the **Firewalls Linodes** page. If the Firewall is assigned to any Linode services they are displayed on the page.

1. Click on the **Add Linodes to Firewall** link.

    ![Assign a Cloud Firewall to a Linode service.](assign-firewall-to-linode-service.png)

1. From the **Add Linode to Firewall** drawer, click on the dropdown menu and select the Linode service to which you'd like to apply this Firewall. You can also start typing the Linode service's label to narrow down your search.

    {{< note >}}
You can assign the Firewall to more than one Linode service at a time. Continue the previous step to assign the Firewall to another Linode service.
    {{</ note >}}

1. Click on the **Add** button to assign the Firewall to your Linode(s).

    ![Click on the Add button to assign the Firewall to your Linode service.](complete-add-firewall-to-service.png)

{{< note >}}
If you have a Cloud Firewall attached to a Linode and you attempt to [migrate the Linode to a data center](/docs/platform/disk-images/how-to-initiate-a-cross-data-center-migration-for-your-linode/) that does not support Cloud Firewalls, the migration will fail.
{{</ note >}}

## Configure Cloud Firewall Rules

Upon initial creation of a Cloud Firewall, you are required to select Firewall rules from a predefined list that supports common networking use cases. This section shows you how to add new Firewall rules to your Firewall's existing rules, edit your Firewall's predefined rules, and delete Firewall rules.

### Add New Cloud Firewall Rules

1. Log into your [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) and select **Firewalls** from the navigation menu.

1. From the **Firewalls** listing page, click on the Firewall that you would like to add new rules to. This takes you to the Firewall's **Rules** page.

1. Click on the **Add an Inbound/Outbound Rule** link (click on the appropriate link for the type of Rule you would like to add).
    ![Click on the Add an Inbound/Outbound Rule link.](add-a-new-firewall-rule.png)

    The **Add an Inbound/Outboud Rule** drawer appears.

1. Provide the following Rule configurations:

    | **Configuration** | **Description** |
    | :---------------: | :---------------: |
    | **Type** | &bull; Select from a list of predefined Firewall rules or select **Custom** to define your own Rule.<br><br>  &bull;Selecting a predefined rule fills in the remaining Rule configuration values, however, they can all be edited.<br><br> &bull;Selecting **Custom**, leaves all configuration values empty for you to define. *Required*|
    | **Protocol** | Select the Transport Layer protocol to use for this Firewall rule. *Required*|
    | **Port Range**| &bull; Provide a port number or a range of ports on which to allow network traffic. <br><br> &bull; This configuration is required for TCP and UDP Firewall rules. `ICMP` does not have a port abstraction, so does not require this configuration.<br><br> &bull; To configure a **Port Range** provide the starting and ending port numbers. For example, `2000-3000`.  *Required*|
    | **Sources / Destinations**| &bull; When creating an **Inbound Rule**, select from a list of **Sources** that limit incoming connections to the chosen internet protocol, netmask, or specific IP address(es).<br><br> &bull; When creating an **Outbound Rule**, select from a list of **Destinations** that limit the outgoing connections to the chosen internet protocol, netmask, or specific IP address(es). |

1. Click on **Add Rule** to add the new rule to this Firewall. If you would like to add any additional rules, repeat the process outlined in this section.

## Update a Cloud Firewall's Status

When you [add a Cloud Firewall](#add-a-cloud-firewall), the Firewall is enabled by default. Enabled means that the Firewall is active and if it is applied to a Linode service it filters your Linode service's network traffic according to the Firewall's rules. Disabling a Firewall deactivates the Firewall and it no longer filters any traffic for the Linode services it has been applied to.

1. Log into your [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) and select **Firewalls** from the navigation menu. This takes you to the **Firewalls** listing page.

1. Click on the **more options ellipsis** corresponding to the Firewall whose status you'd like to update.

1. From the dropdown menu, click on **Enable/Disable** to update the Firewall's status.

    ![Update your Firewall's status.](update-the-firewall-status.png)

    The **Status** column on the **Firewalls** listing page updates to display the Firewall's current status.

    ![View the updated status of your Firewall.](view-the-firewall-status.png)

## Delete a Cloud Firewall

1. Log into your [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) and select **Firewalls** from the navigation menu. This takes you to the **Firewalls** listing page.

1. Click on the **more options ellipsis** corresponding to the Firewall that you'd like to delete.

1. From the dropdown menu, click on **Delete**. You are prompted to confirm deleting the Firewall. Click **Delete** to proceed.
