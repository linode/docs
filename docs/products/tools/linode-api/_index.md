## Features

### Build the Apps You Want
Create your own dev tools with the Linode API. Build scripts and applications to automatically handle repeatable tasks.

The Linode API provides access to every part of the Linode platform. Deploy Kubernetes clusters, attach block or object storage volumes, configure NodeBalancers, manage users, and more.

All response data is returned in JSON for easy parsing and filtering.

### Third-party Integrations and Plugins
A range of third-party integrations consume the Linode API. Describe your infrastructure as code with Linodeâ€™s Terraform provider or manage your Linode Kubernetes clusters with Rancher.

### Programmatically Manage Your Account
Automate account management. View everything from invoices to billing with the Linode API endpoints.

### Secure Authentication
Never worry about unauthorized modifications to your account. Access tokens are required for every request to the API and OAuth is available for applications with multiple users.
