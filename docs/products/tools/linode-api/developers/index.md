## Linode API

Linodeâ€™s [API v4](/docs/api) provides the ability to programmatically manage the full range of Linode products and services.

## Linode CLI

The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that allows you to manage your Linode account and resources from the command line.

## Linode Developed/Supported Tools

- [Terraform](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/linode/): Linode's official Terraform Provider. Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-code tool that includes management features for various types of Linode resources.

- [Rancher](/docs/applications/containers/how-to-deploy-apps-with-rancher-1/): Rancher's UI centralizes Kubernetes management concerns when dealing with multiple clusters across multiple clouds.

- [Pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-linode): Pulumi lets you use the full feature set of a general purpose programming language, like Python, JavaScript, and GO to manage Linode resources.

- [Packer Builder](https://github.com/linode/packer-builder-linode): The Packer Builder plugin for Linode Images makes it easy to create private Linode Images. Linode Images can be used in subsequent deployments in any Linode region.

- [Block Storage CSI Driver](https://github.com/linode/linode-blockstorage-csi-driver): Container Storage Interface driver for Linode Block Storage integration with Kubernetes and other container orchestrators.

- [Terraform-linode-k8s](https://github.com/linode/terraform-linode-k8s): Terraform Kubernetes installer for Linode. Creates a Kubernetes Cluster on Linode Cloud infrastructure using the ContainerLinux operating system. The cluster is designed to take advantage of the Linode regional private network, and is equipped with Linode cluster enhancements including the CCM, CSI, and ExternalDNS.

- [Linode Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/linode/linode-cloud-controller-manager): Kubernetes Addon featuring automatic provisioning of Linode's NodeBalancers to enable load balancing services and includes Linode status reporting to allow resources to be rescheduled when Linodes are powered down or removed.

- [Linode Docker Machine Driver](https://github.com/linode/docker-machine-driver-linode): The Linode Docker Machine Driver provisions Linode instances to run Docker Engine.

- [Docker Volume Driver for Block Storage](https://github.com/linode/docker-volume-linode): The Docker Volume Driver for Linode Block Storage makes it possible to use Docker commands to provision, attach, and detach volumes to containers. Volumes can be destroyed automatically when not in use.
