- [Get an API Access Token](/docs/products/tools/linode-api/guides/get-access-token): You need an access token to make changes to your account with the API. You can get one in the Cloud Manager.

- [Get Configuration Parameters](/docs/products/tools/linode-api/guides/get-config-parameters): Get type, region, or image for Linodes.

- [Build the Final Query](/docs/products/tools/linode-api/guides/build-final-query): Use the example below and replace the values with your own to build your query.

- [Revoke an API Token](/docs/products/tools/linode-api/guides/revoke-access-token): If you forget your access token or think it may have been compromised, you can revoke an API access token in the Cloud Manager.
