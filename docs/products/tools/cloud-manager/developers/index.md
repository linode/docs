## Linode API

Linodeâ€™s [API v4](/docs/api) provides the ability to programmatically manage the full range of Linode products and services, and powers Cloud Manager.

## Linode CLI

The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that lets you manage your Linode account and resources from the command line, similar to Cloud Manager.
