The **Longview** section of Cloud Manager gives you access to Linodeâ€™s system data graphing service. It tracks metrics for CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, both aggregate and per-process, and it provides real-time graphs that can help expose performance problems. The Longview service offers both [free and paid plan tiers](/docs/platform/longview/what-is-longview/#longview-plan-details).

To get started using Longview, see the [Understanding Linode Longview](/docs/platform/longview/what-is-longview/) guide.
