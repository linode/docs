The Cloud Manager supports the OAuth 2 authorization protocol. OAuth 2 allows a user to safely grant a third-party app permission to act on their behalf. This means that a user could authorize an app to access data and / or make changes to their Linode account and services that are exposed by the [Linode APIv4](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/). For example, an app could create or destroy Linodes, manage a NodeBalancer, or alter a domain.

To learn how to get started with OAuth Apps see the [How To Create an OAuth App with the Linode Python API Library](/docs/platform/api/how-to-create-an-oauth-app-with-the-linode-python-api-library/) guide. For details on the Linode API v4's OAuth workflow see the [Linode API v4 documentation](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/#o-auth).
