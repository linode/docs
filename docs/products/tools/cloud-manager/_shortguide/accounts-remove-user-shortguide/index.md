You can permanently remove a user account from the Linode Cloud Manager. Here's how:

1.  Click the **Account** link in the sidebar.
1.  Click the **Users** tab.
1.  Click the **Delete** link for the desired user. A warning appears asking you to confirm that you want to delete the user.
1.  Click **Delete** in the warning to confirm deletion.

The user is removed and is no longer able to access the Linode Cloud Manager.
