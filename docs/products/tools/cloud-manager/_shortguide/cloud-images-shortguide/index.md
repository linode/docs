The Images section of Cloud Manager gives you access to Linode Images which allow you to take snapshots of your disks, and then deploy them to any Linode under your account. This can be useful for bootstrapping a master image for a large deployment, or retaining a disk for a configuration that you may not need running, but wish to return to in the future.

To get started using Images with Cloud Manager, see [Linode Images](/docs/platform/disk-images/linode-images/).
