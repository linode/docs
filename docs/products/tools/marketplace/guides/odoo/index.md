## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Odoo App

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the custom domain you entered during deployment or your Compute Instance's rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#configuring-rdns) guide for information on viewing the rDNS value.

1.  Within the Odoo setup page that appears, save the automatically generated admin password (also called the *master password*), enter *odoo* as the **Database Name**, and fill out the remaining details for your account.
