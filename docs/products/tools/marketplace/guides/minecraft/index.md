With over 100 million users around the world, [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/) is the most popular online game of all time. You and other players are free to build and explore in a 3D generated world made up of millions of mineable blocks. Collect resources by leveling mountains, taming forests, and venturing out to sea. Choose a home from the varied list of biomes like ice worlds, flower plains, and jungles. Build ancient castles or modern mega cities and fill them with redstone circuit contraptions and villagers. Fight off nightly invasions of Skeletons, Zombies, and explosive Creepers, or adventure to the End and the Nether to summon the fabled End Dragon and the chaotic Wither. If that is not enough, Minecraft is also highly moddable and customizable. You decide the rules when hosting your own Minecraft server for you and your friends to play together in this highly addictive game.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

{{< content "marketplace-verify-standard-shortguide">}}

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** Minecraft should be fully installed within 5-10 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended plan:** The plan size should be based on the amount of traffic you expect to see on your server. We recommend 2GB of RAM for every 15 players. For example, if you are expecting a small group of players (between 1-15), the 2GB plan should suffice. Up to 30 players, a 4GB instance would be a better fit.

### Minecraft Options

- **The username for the Linode's admin/SSH user** *(required)*: This is the limited user account to be created for the Linode. This account has sudo user privileges. Only use lowercase characters. This username does not (and, for security reasons, likely should not) be the same as your Mojang or Microsoft account.
- **The password for the Linode's admin/SSH user** *(required)*: Set a password for the limited sudo user. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. This password can be used to perform any action on your server, similar to root, so make it long, complex, and unique.
- **World Name:** The world name and it's corresponding file name. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Message of the Day:** Text that is displayed whenever a player logs on to the server. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Flight Enabled:** Allows flight if there is a mod installed that supports flying. This configuration has no effect on creative mode flight. *Advanced Configuration*.

- **World Type:** Type of world to generate. *Default* = standard, *flat* = featureless and flat, *largebiomes* = larger biomes, *amplified* = larger height limit. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **World Seed:** A random value used by Minecraft's world generation algorithm to create a unique world. For example: `qazwsx123`. See [Minecraft's Gamepedia](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Seed_(level_generation)) entry on seeds for more information. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Spawn Animals Enabled:** Determines if animals (sheep, chickens, squid, etc.) spawn. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Spawn Monsters Enabled:** Determines if monsters (creepers, skeletons, spiders, etc.) spawn. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Spawn NPCs Enabled:** Determines if villagers spawn. *Advanced Configuration*.

- **Maximum Build Height:** Maximum height at which players can place blocks. World generation may exceed this limit. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Maximum World Size:** Maximum radius of the world, in blocks. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **View Distance:** The distance a player can see, measured in chunks (16 block cubes). For example, `10` enables the user to see 10 chunks in any direction.

- **RCON Password:** The RCON password. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **RCON Port:** The port used for RCON. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Maximum Tick Time:** The maximum amount of milliseconds a single tick can take before the server considers itself frozen or crashed and shuts down. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Network Compression Threshold:** The threshold at which bytes are compressed. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Op-permission Level:** Sets the permission level for operators (ops) when using the `/op` command. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Port Number:** The server's listening port number. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Snooper Enabled:** Determines if the server sends stats to [https://snoop.minecraft.net](https://snoop.minecraft.net). *Advanced Configuration*.
- **Use Native Transport Enabled:** Improve server performance by optimizing sent and received packets. *Advanced Configuration*.
- **SSH public key for the limited user:** If you wish to login as the limited user through public key authentication (without entering a password), enter your public key here. See [Creating an SSH Key Pair and Configuring Public Key Authentication on a Server](/docs/guides/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) for instructions on generating a key pair.
- **Disable root access over SSH:** To block the root user from logging in over SSH, select *Yes* (recommended). You can still switch to the root user once logged in and you can also log in as root through [Lish](/docs/guides/lish/).

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Join Your New Minecraft Server

1. Open the Minecraft Launcher on your local machine and launch **Minecraft: Java Edition**. If you do not yet have Minecraft, you must obtain a license and install it. See [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition) store page for details on purchasing it.

1. Once Minecraft is running, select the **Multiplayer** option.

    {{< note >}}
    If there is a red *X* over the status bars or if the word *old* appears, then your Compute Instance might not have finished installing Minecraft. Please double check your IPv4 address, wait a few minutes,and then hit **Refresh**.

## Customization After Installation

After installation you can change your Minecraft options by customizing the system configuration files.

- **Customize the Minecraft Service**

    The system service file is located in your home directory: `~/etc/systemd/system/mcserver.service`. You can update this file to optimize your server's performance.

- **Customize the Minecraft World Options**

    The files to configure the world options are also located in your home directory: `~/serverfiles`. Here you find `server.properties`, `banned-ips.json`, and more. The name of the world you created during installation has a folder here as well. Inside this folder are other configuration files for that specific world.
