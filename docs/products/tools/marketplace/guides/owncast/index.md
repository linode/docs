## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Owncast App

After Owncast has finished installing, you can access your server with your Linode's IPv4 address. Copy your Linodeâ€™s IPv4 address from the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com), and then connect to the server from your browser using your Linode's IPv4 address and port `8080`(for example `192.0.2.0:8080`).

With Owncast running, you can begin to configure your new server. Visit the Admin settings, located at `/admin` (for example `192.0.2.0:8080/admin`). Visit the [Configuration Instructions](https://owncast.online/docs/configuration/?source=linodemarketplace) to learn how you can change your video settings, web page content, and more.

On the server, Owncast is installed in the  `/opt/owncast` directory. You'll find all your data files there. This is also where you can upgrade your Owncast server in the future.
