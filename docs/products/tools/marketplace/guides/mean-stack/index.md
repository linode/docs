A MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack is a free and open-source web software bundle used to build modern web applications:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document database used to persist your application's data.

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) serves as the web application framework.

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) is used to build your application's user interfaces using JavaScript. Angular offers Web Workers and server-side rendering that helps your applications achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) serves as the run-time environment for your application.

- [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io) is a daemon process manager that helps you manage and keep your application online.

MEAN is a full-stack JavaScript-based framework consisting of MongoDB database, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS. You can build entire web applications on JavaScript, from client to server to database with this stack. Single-language programming makes it easier to develop working applications more quickly without sacrificing functionality and features.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

{{< content "marketplace-verify-standard-shortguide">}}

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** The MEAN stack should be fully installed within 2-5 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended minimum plan:** 1GB Shared Compute Instance or higher, depending on the number of sites and size of the sites you plan on hosting.

### MEAN Options

- **Email address** *(required)*: Enter the email address to use for generating the SSL certificates.

## Getting Started After Deployment

Once deployed, a "Hello World" sample application should be running on `http://localhost:3000`. An Nginx reverse proxy then serves the application through your custom domain or rDNS domain over ports 80 and 443. Follow the instructions below to view or access it.

### Accessing the MEAN App through the Command Line

The MEAN sample application is stored in the `/opt/mean/` directory. To access it within the command line, follow the instructions below.

1.  Log in to your Compute Instance via [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/guides/lish/).

1.  Navigate to the directory in which the application is stored:

        cd /opt/mean/

1.  Open the sample application with your preferred command line text editor, such as [nano](/docs/guides/use-nano-to-edit-files-in-linux/) or [vim](/docs/guides/what-is-vi/).

        nano server.js

### Viewing the MEAN App through a Web Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to `https://[domain]`, where *[domain]* can be replaced with the custom domain you entered during deployment or your Compute Instance's rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing rDNS.

## Software Included

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MongoDB** | Document-based database |
| **Express** | Web application framework |
| **Angular** | JavaScript library |
| **Node JS** | Runtime environment |
| **PM2**     | Daemon process manager |
| **NGINX** | Web server |
| **UFW (UncomplicatedFirewall)** | Firewall utility. Ports 22, 80, and 443 for IPv4 and IPv6 are set to allow traffic. All other ports have the following firewall rules: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing). |
