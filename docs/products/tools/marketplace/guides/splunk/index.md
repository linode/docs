Splunk is a powerful log analyzer that can be used to obtain insight into your infrastructure. Splunk collects, monitors, analyzes, and visualizes data from database applications, web servers, cloud networks, and a variety of other sources.

The Akamai Connected Cloud Splunk Marketplace App includes support for the [Akamai SIEM integration](https://techdocs.akamai.com/siem-integration/docs/akamai-siem-integration-for-splunk-and-cef-syslog) on deployment. For details on generating valid tokens, see [create authentication credentials](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials).

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Obtaining the Admin Password

The password for the sudo user account was automatically generated during the initial install process. To find this password, log in to your Compute Instance through the [LISH Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/#through-the-cloud-manager-weblish). The credentials are available in the file `/home/$USERNAME/.credentials`
```
cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
sudo username: $USERNAME
sudo password: 0oVSsWmkbGesmtuTlOEgFl7t
splunk user: $SPLUNK_USER
splunk admin password: fRLdHksJoMPrjLtRCogEPVLYOML1zQtQ0kIsL7IWvo49
```

### Access your Splunk App

Open a browser and navigate to `https://192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com:8000`, where `192-0-2-1` represents the IPv4 address of your new Compute Instance. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/#configuring-rdns) guide for information on viewing the rDNS value.

You will be presented a login field where you can enter the credentials you previously specified in the *Splunk Username* and the generated *Splunk Password* in `/home/$USERNAME/.credentials`.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your dashboard, checkout [the official Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk) to learn how to further configure your instance.
