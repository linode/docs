## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Splunk App

Open a browser and navigate to your [Linode's IP address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/) and port `8000`, for example, `http://192.0.2.0:8000/`. You will be presented a login field where you can enter the credentials you previously specified in the *Splunk Username* and *Splunk Password* fields when you deployed the app.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your dashboard, checkout [the official Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk) to learn how to further configure your instance.
