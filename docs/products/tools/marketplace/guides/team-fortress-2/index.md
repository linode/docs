Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game. In TF2, you and your team choose from 9 unique classes and play against an enemy team in a variety of game modes. These modes include capture the flag, king of the hill, and even a battle pitting your team against a robotic horde.

Setting up a personal game server puts you in control of the game modes and maps you use, as well as a variety of other settings to customize your experience.

## Getting Started after Deployment

Ensure that you have installed Team Fortress 2 to your computer before getting started with this section. You can install Team Fortress 2 from [Steam's Web Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/).

After the Team Fortress 2 Server Marketplace App has finished deploying to your Linode, you will be able to access your server by copying your Linode's IPv4 address and connecting to it within the game installed on your computer. To find your Linode's IPv4 address and connect to it:

1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the sidebar. You will see a list of all your Linodes.

2. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

3. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

4. Under the **IPv4** heading, you will find your IPv4 address listed under the **Address** column.

5. Copy the IPv4 address.

6. Open Team Fortress 2 on your computer, then open the developer's console by pressing the back tick key (**`**).

7. Type `connect 192.0.2.155`. Replace 192.0.2.155 with the IP address of your Linode, and then click **Submit**.
