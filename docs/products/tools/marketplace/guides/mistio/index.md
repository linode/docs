[Mist.io](https://mist.io/) is an open source, multi-cloud management platform. Mist supports all popular infrastructure technologies including public clouds, private clouds, hypervisors, containers, and bare metal servers. It provides a unified interface for performing common management tasks like provisioning, orchestration, monitoring, automation, and cost analysis. It also comes with a RESTful API so you can easily integrate it in your existing workflows.
