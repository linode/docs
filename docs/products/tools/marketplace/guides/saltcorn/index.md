## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Saltcorn App

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `https://[domain]/`, where *[domain]* can be replaced with the custom domain you entered during deployment or your Compute Instance's rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing rDNS.
