Terraria is a two-dimensional sandbox game in which players explore the world, collect resources, build structures, and battle enemies in procedurally generated environments. In Terraria a player begins by digging for ore, and the further they dig the more adventure they find. Multiplayer mode can be either cooperative or PvP.

Hosting your own Terraria server gives you control over the world, the players, and the objectives. Your world, your rules.

## Getting Started after Deployment

After Terraria has finished installing, you will be able to access your server by copying your Linode's IPv4 address from the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) and then connecting to it within the game.

{{< note type="alert" >}}
You must disable Steam Guard to connect to your Terraria server. If you don't disable Steam Guard, you may be locked out of your account and will need to reset your password. To disable Steam Guard, navigate to the Steam Preferences menu, then open the **Account** pane. Click on **Manage Steam Guard Account Security**, then click on **Turn Steam Guard off**.

2. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

3. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

4. Your IPv4 address will be listed under the **Address** column in the **IPv4** table.
