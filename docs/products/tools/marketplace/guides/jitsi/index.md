## Getting Started After Deployment

Jitsi is now installed and ready to use.

1.  Before you go to your app, if you filled out the optional Jitsi configuration fields:

    - In the Cloud Manager [DNS Manager](/docs/products/networking/dns-manager/guides/create-domain/) there is now an entry for your domain with two `A/AAAA` records pointing to your new server. One for the domain name and one for the hostname.
    - [Configure the rDNS](/docs/guides/configure-rdns/) on your Linode.

1.  If you didn't setup a domain, navigate to the rDNS address of the Linode in your browser. You can find the rDNS address in the **Networking** tab for your Linode in the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com). If you did setup a domain, navigate to the address as described in the [Jitsi Options](#jitsi-options) section above.

1.  Jitsi prompts you to start a meeting.
