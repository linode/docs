[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) is a quick and light-weight web framework for Python that includes several utilities and libraries you can use to create a web application. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to support more complex applications.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

{{< content "marketplace-verify-standard-shortguide">}}

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** Flask should be fully installed within 2-5 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Debian 10
- **Recommended minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Installed Software

In addition to installing Flask, this Marketplace app installs and configures software to support running Flask in a production environment. Below is a list of the installed software:

- The [NGINX](/docs/guides/getting-started-with-nginx-part-1-installation-and-basic-setup/) web server is installed with a basic NGINX configuration, located in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/flask_app`, and listening on your Linode's IP address.
- An example Flask application is downloaded to your Linode's `/home/flask_app_project` directory. If you visit your [Linode's IP address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/), you will see the example Flask application running and serving boiler plate blog content.
- Your example Flask application's environment will be configured with basic settings located in the `/etc/config.json` file.
- [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), a Python WSGI (web server gateway interface) HTTP Server for UNIX, is installed and running. It is used to forward requests from your NGINX web server to your Flask application.
- [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/), a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems, is installed and running on your Linode. Its configuration file can be found in the following location, `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/flask_app.conf`.
- The example Flask app's logs can be found in the following locations, `var/log/flask_app/flask_app.out.log` and `/var/log/flask_app/flask_app.err.log`

### Removing Default Application

Users may find that they need to remove access to the default Flask application on port 80 to free up space for another application, or to otherwise remove components. The following steps can help to disable and decouple various aspects of the default Flask application included with the Flask Marketplace App:

- Unlink the default NGINX site for the Flask app:

      sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/flask_app

- Stop the application from being monitored and maintained by supervisorctl:

      sudo supervisorctl stop all

- Remove configuration files for the Flask application:

      sudo rm -rf /home/flask_app_project
      sudo rm /etc/config.json

- Remove the Supervisor configuration files:

      sudo rm /etc/supervisor/conf.d/flask_app.conf

{{< note >}}
Many configuration files can be overwritten to support a new configuration instead of deleted outright. For more information on the default configuration, see our [Flask Installation Guide](/docs/guides/flask-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu/) and the [Installed Software Section](/docs/products/tools/marketplace/guides/flask/#installed-software) of this guide.

### Next Steps

{{< content "marketplace-update-note-shortguide">}}

Now that you are familiar with all the software installed on your Linode with the Flask Marketplace app, you can explore the following steps:

- [Connect to your Linode via SSH](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/#connect-to-the-instance). You will need your Linode's root password to proceed. You can explore the installed programs and update any configurations as needed. Consider following the steps in the [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to continue hardening your Linode's security.
- Read through our [Deploy a Flask Application on Ubuntu](/docs/guides/flask-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu/) guide, which takes a deeper dive into the example Flask app that is deployed by the Marketplace app.
- Visit our [Create a GIS Application using Flask, Stadia Maps, and MongoDB](/docs/guides/how-to-create-a-gis-app-using-flask-stadia-maps-and-mongodb/) guide to learn how to create your own GIS application.
- Consult our [How To Create an OAuth App with the Linode Python API Library](/docs/products/tools/api/guides/create-an-oauth-app-with-the-python-api-library/) to learn how to develop a Flask app using Linode's API to automate creating Linode resources.
