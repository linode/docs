NirvaShare is a simplified and secure enterprise file sharing solution built on top of your existing file storage. Use NirvaShare with SFTP, local storage, or even S3-compatible storage like Linode's [Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/). Collaborate with your internal or external users such as customers, partners, and vendors. NirvaShare provides fine-tuned access control in a very simplified manner. NirvaShare integrates with multiple many external identity providers such as Active Directory, GSuite, AWS SSO, KeyClock, and others.

After NirvaShare has finished installing, you can access your NirvaShare instance by visiting your [Linode's IP address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/) at port 8080. (for example, `http://192.0.2.0:8080`)

Once you visit the NirvaShare IP address you will be prompted with a Login page, you can enter `admin` as the *username* and `admin` as the *password*.
