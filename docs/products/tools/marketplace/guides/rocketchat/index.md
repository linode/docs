## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Rocket.Chat App

1.  Open a browser and navigate to the domain you created in the beginning of your deployment. You can also use your Compute Instance's rDNS, which will appear like `203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing and setting the rDNS value.

1.  From there, Rocket.Chat prompts you to fill out multiple forms to get your instance created and ready to use:
