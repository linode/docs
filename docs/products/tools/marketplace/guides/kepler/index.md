## Getting Started After Deployment

### Access Your WordPress Site

After Kepler has finished installing, you can access your WordPress site by copying your Linode's IPv4 address and entering it in the browser of your choice. If you've set up DNS during installation, you can go to your domain name in the browser. To find your Linode's IPv4 address:

1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the sidebar to see a list of all your Linodes.

1. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

1. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

1. Your IPv4 address is listed under the **Address** column in the **IPv4** table.

1. Copy and paste the IPv4 address into a browser window. You should see your WordPress site's home page.
