[aaPanel](https://www.aapanel.com/) is a free and open source web hosting control panel. It allows you to manage the server's web server, websites, databases, FTP, and more through a simple web-based interface. Through aaPanel, you can quickly install a LEMP (NGINX) or LAMP (Apache) stack on your server and start hosting your websites.
