[ARK: Survival Evolved](http://playark.com/ark-survival-evolved/) is a multiplayer action-survival game released in 2017. The game places you on a series of fictional islands inhabited by dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. In ARK, the main objective is to survive. ARK is an ongoing battle where animals and other players have the ability to destroy you. To survive, you must build structures, farm resources, breed dinosaurs, and even set up trading hubs with neighboring tribes.

This Marketplace App deploys the ARK: Survival Evolved server software through [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD). Hosting an ARK server gives you control of the entire game. You can define the leveling speed, the amount of players, and the types of weapons that are available. While no additional license is required to run the server, each client needs to have a license for the game.
