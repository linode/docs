[CyberPanel](https://cyberpanel.net/) is a next-generation hosting control panel, which provides a friendly user interface. The CyberPanel app provides a One-Click installer for OpenLiteSpeed, LSCache, WordPress, Prestashop, Joomla, Magento, and Git. It also automates the initial setup for components like mail service and DNS to reduce the time it takes to get set up.

{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** CentOS 7, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your CyberPanel App

1.  When the installation completes, log into your Linode via SSH, replacing `192.0.2.0` with your [Linode's IP address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/), and entering your Linode's root password when prompted:

         ssh root@192.0.2.0

1.  You should see the CyberPanel welcome messsage when logging into the Linode. This will include instructions for accessing CyberPanel, phpMyAdmin, and RainLoop in your web browser. Replace `192.0.2.0` with your Linode's IP address.

    ```output
    Welcome to LiteSpeed One-Click CyberPanel Server.
    To keep this server secure, the firewalld is enabled.
    CyberPanel One-Click Quickstart guide:
    * https://docs.litespeedtech.com/cloud/images/cyberpanel/

    In a web browser, you can view:
    * CyberPanel: https://192.0.2.0:8090
    * phpMyAdmin: https://192.0.2.0:8090/phpmyadmin
    * RainLoop:   https://192.0.2.0:8090/rainloop

    On the server:
    * You can get the CyberPanel admin password with the following command:
    sudo cat /root/.litespeed_password
    * You can get the Mysql cyberpanel user password with the following command:
    sudo cat /root/.db_password

    System Status:
    Load : 0.06, 0.53, 0.43
    CPU  : 30.0763%
    RAM  : 355/3936MB (9.02%)
    Disk : 7/79GB (10%)

    Your CyberPanel is up to date

    ```

1.  Obtain your CyberPanel administrator password from the command line.

        cat .litespeed_password

     You should see output similar to the following:

    ```output
    admin_pass=qN1Jo7XKCekN8ZAV
    ```

    In the above example, the password is `qN1Jo7XKCekN8ZAV`.

1.  Visit the CyberPanel administration panel by visiting your Linode's IP in a web browser on port 8090. For example, if your IP address is `192.0.2.0`, you would visit `https://192.0.20:8090`.

    {{< note >}}
    CyberPanel uses a self-signed certificate issued by LiteSpeedCommunity. Because it is not signed by a common Certificate Authority, your browser may warn about the security of the connection and require you to add a security exception.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Log in to the administration panel using the username `admin` and the password you obtained in step three.
