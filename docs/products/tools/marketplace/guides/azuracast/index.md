## Getting Started After Deployment

### Accessing AzuraCast

AzuraCast is now installed and ready to use.

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://[ip-address]/`, replacing *[ip-address]* with your Compute Instance's IPv4 address. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing your IP address.

1.  The first thing you want to do is create a *Super Administrator* account that has system-wide permissions.

Learn more about using a custom URL with Linode DNS in our [DNS Manager](/docs/products/networking/dns-manager/) guide. When you are finished, click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the screen to continue.

1.  Your station is now ready. On the following page, you are taken to the control panel, and you are ready to start broadcasting your station.

1.  To manage the station you just created click the **Manage** button in the **Station Overview** section. This will open the Station Dashboard for the station you created during setup.
