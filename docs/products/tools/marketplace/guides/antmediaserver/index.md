[Ant Media Server](https://antmedia.io/) is an [open source](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server) video streaming platform known for its scalability and low latency. It supports WebRTC live streaming, as well as CMAF and HLS streaming, and can be ingested through RTMP, WebRTC, or HLS. There are two editions of Ant Media Server: Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. This Marketplace App installs the Community Edition.

The Community Edition is a limited version of Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition and supports the following features.

- Publish live streams with WebRTC, RTMP - Play Live and VoD streams with RTMP and HLS
- RTMP, RTSP, MP4 and HLS Support
- WebRTC to RTMP Adapter
- 360 Degree Live & VoD Streams
- Web Management Dashboard
- IP Camera Support
- Re-stream Remote Streams (IPTV)
- Open Source https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server
- Simulcasting to Periscope
- Your Live or VoD streams can play anywhere including mobile(Android, iOS) browsers.

If you need adaptive streaming, cluster, load balancer, and hardware encoding, consider using the [Enterprise Edition](/docs/products/tools/marketplace/guides/antmediaenterpriseserver/).
