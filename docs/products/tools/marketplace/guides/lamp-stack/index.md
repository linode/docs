A LAMP (Linux, [Apache](https://www.apache.org), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com), [PHP](https://www.php.net)) stack is a popular, free, and open-source web software bundle used for hosting websites on Linux. This software environment is a foundation for popular PHP application frameworks like WordPress, Drupal, and Laravel. After you deploy your LAMP Marketplace App, you can upload your existing PHP application code to it or use a PHP framework to write a new application on your Linode.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< content "marketplace-verify-standard-shortguide">}}

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** The LAMP stack should be fully installed within 2-5 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Debian 10, Debian 11, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended minimum plan:** 1GB Shared Compute Instance or higher, depending on the number of sites and size of the sites you plan on hosting.

### LAMP Stack Options

- **MySQL Root Password** *(required)*: The root password for your LAMP stack's MySQL database. This is not the same as the Linux root user password.
- **Email address** *(required)*: Enter the email address to use for generating the SSL certificates.

## Getting Started After Deployment

After your LAMP stack has finished deploying, you can:

- [Connect to your Linode via SSH](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/#connect-to-the-instance). You will need your Linode's root password to proceed. Note that your Linode's web root will be located in the `/var/www/html` directory.

- [Navigate to the public IP address or domain entered during creation](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/#update-your-systems-hosts-filefind-your-linode-s-ip-address) of your Linode in a browser. You will see the default Apache webpage.

- Consult the following guides to learn more about working with the various components of the LAMP stack:

    - [Secure HTTP Traffic with Certbot](/docs/guides/secure-http-traffic-certbot/)
    - [Apache Configuration Basics](/docs/guides/apache-configuration-basics/)
    - [How to Optimize MySQL Performance Using MySQLTuner](/docs/guides/how-to-optimize-mysql-performance-using-mysqltuner/)

-   Upload files to your web root directory with an SFTP application like [FileZilla](/docs/guides/filezilla/). Use the same root credentials that you would use for SSH.

-   Assign a domain name to your Linode's IP address. Review the [DNS Manager](/docs/products/networking/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on setting up your DNS records in the Cloud Manager, and read through [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/guides/dns-overview/) for general information about how DNS works.

## Software Included

The LAMP Stack Marketplace App installs the following software on your Linode:

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| [**Apache HTTP Server**](https://www.apache.org) | Web server that can be used to serve your site or web application.|
| [**MySQL Server**](https://www.mysql.com) | Relational database. |
| [**PHP 7**](https://www.php.net) | General purpose programming language. |
| [**UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall) | Firewall utility. Ports 22/tcp, 80/tcp, and 443/tcp for IPv4 and IPv6 will allow outgoing and incoming traffic. |
