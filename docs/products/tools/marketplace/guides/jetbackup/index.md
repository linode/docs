[JetBackup](https://www.jetbackup.com/) is a backup solution that can integrate with cPanel or be used as a standalone software within supported Linux distributions. It offers flexible backup management options, including the ability to perform off-site backups through S3-compatible storage (like Linode's [Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/)).

{{< note >}}
JetBackup requires a valid license to use the software beyond the available 10 day [free trial](https://cpanel.net/products/trial/) period. To purchase a license, visit [JetBackup's website](https://billing.jetapps.com/index.php?rp=/store/prorated-license) and select a plan that fits your needs. Licenses are not available directly through Linode.

- **Release Tier** *(Required)*: Choose a JetBackup Release Tier. Select either stable (recommended), beta, or edge.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your JetBackup App

#### cPanel/WHM

To access JetBackup 5 in cPanel/WHM after installation, navigate to WHM Home > Plugins > JetBackup 5.

#### Standalone App

To access your JetBackup instance, Open a browser and navigate to your Linode rDNS domain `http://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com:3035/`. Replace `http://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com` with your [Linode's RDNS domain](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#viewing-ip-addresses). This will bring you to a login page, where you can use the root credentials to the server to enter the JetBackup dashboard.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your dashboard, checkout [the official JetBackup documentation](https://docs.jetbackup.com/v5.1/adminpanel/gettingStarted.html#gettingstarted) to learn how to further configure your instance.
