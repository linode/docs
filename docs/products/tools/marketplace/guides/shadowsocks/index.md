Shadowsocks is a lightweight SOCKS5 web proxy tool primarily utilized to bypass network censorship and blocking on certain websites and web protocols. A full setup requires a Linode server to host the Shadowsocks daemon, and a client installed on PC, Mac, Linux, or a mobile device. Unlike other proxy software, Shadowsocks traffic is designed to be both indiscernible from other traffic to third-party monitoring tools, and also able to disguise itself as a normal direct connection. Data passing through Shadowsocks is encrypted for additional security and privacy.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** Shadowsocks should be fully installed within 2-5 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used, though consider the amount of traffic needed for the VPN and select a plan with enough *Outbound Network Transfer* to handle the expected traffic.

### Shadowsocks Options

- **Shadowsock Password** *(required)*: Enter a *strong* password for your Shadowsocks user.

## Getting Started after Deployment

Once the Shadowsocks server is up and running, you must install the [Shadowsocks Client](https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html) on any device or devices that you'd like to have connect to the service. There are currently client services available for [Windows](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/releases), [Mac OS X](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/), [Linux](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.shadowsocks), and [iOS](http://apt.thebigboss.org/onepackage.php?bundleid=com.linusyang.shadowsocks).

For a full set of instructions on how to install Shadowsocks on Windows and Mac OS X, see the [Install a Shadowsocks Client](/docs/guides/create-a-socks5-proxy-server-with-shadowsocks-on-ubuntu-and-centos7/#install-a-shadowsocks-client) section of our guide for [Creating a Shadowsocks Server Manually](/docs/guides/create-a-socks5-proxy-server-with-shadowsocks-on-ubuntu-and-centos7/).

When the client has completed the installation process, ensure that you're setting up your client to connect using the following unique information:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Address** | Your linodes IPv4 address. Can be found in the `Linodes` section of the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes).
| **Port** | The Shadowsocks Marketplace App connects through port `8000` by default. |
| **Encryption** | Set to use the `aes-256-gcm` encryption mode. |
| **Password** | This is the `Shadowsocks Password` field you created when initially deploying your app. |

After configuration, your `Server Preferences` should be similar to the following image:
