#### Limited User SSH Options (Optional)

- **SSH public key for the limited user:** If you wish to login as the limited user through public key authentication (without entering a password), enter your public key here. See [Creating an SSH Key Pair and Configuring Public Key Authentication on a Server](/docs/guides/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) for instructions on generating a key pair.
- **Disable root access over SSH:** To block the root user from logging in over SSH, select *Yes* (recommended). You can still switch to the root user once logged in and you can also log in as root through [Lish](/docs/guides/lish/).

## Getting Started After Deployment

### Access Your Moodle App

To access your Moodle instance, Open a browser and navigate to your Linode rDNS domain `https://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. Replace `https://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com` with your [Linode's RDNS domain](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#viewing-ip-addresses).

From there, you can login by clicking the box on the top right of the page. Once you see the login page, you can enter `moodle` as the *username* and the *password* that was entered during the creation of the Linode.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your dashboard, checkout [the official Moodle documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Main_page) to learn how to further configure your instance.
