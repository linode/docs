[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) is an open source container registry platform, cloud-native content storage, and signing/scanning tool. Harbor enhances the open source Docker distribution by providing features like security, identification, and management. The image transfer efficiency can be improved by having a registry closer to the build and run environment. Harbor includes comprehensive security features like user administration, access control, and activity auditing, as well as image replication between registries.

Harbor is an excellent compliment to the [Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/).

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Harbor App

1.  Open a browser and navigate to the domain you created in the beginning of your deployment. You can also use your Compute Instance's rDNS, which may look like `203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing and setting the rDNS value.

1.  In the Harbor login screen that appears, enter `admin` as the username and use the *Admin password* you created in the beginning of your deployment.
