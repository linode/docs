[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is a server-side web application framework that allows web designers and developers to implement dynamic, fully featured web applications.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

{{< content "marketplace-verify-standard-shortguide">}}

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** Ruby on Rails should be fully installed within 2-5 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

### Ruby on Rails Options

- **Rails Application name** *(required)*: The name for your rails application.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access Ruby on Rails

After Ruby on Rails has finished installing, you will be able to access Ruby on Rails from the console via ssh with your Linode's IPv4 address:

1.  [SSH into your Linode](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/#connect-to-the-instance) and [create a limited user account](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/#add-a-limited-user-account).

1.  Log out and log back in as your limited user account.

1.  Update your server:

        sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

1.  Ruby comes with some pre-made scripts to get you started. One of these is a blog. To begin with the blog example, use the following command:

        rails new blog

    This creates a new Rails application called Blog in the `blog` directory.

1.  Move into the `blog` directory:

        cd blog

1.  Start the built in server with the following command, replacing the IP address with your Linode's IP address:

        rails server --binding=198.51.100.0

    ```output
    Warning: Running `gem pristine --all` to regenerate your installed gemspecs (and deleting then reinstalling your bundle if you use bundle --path) will improve the startup performance of Spring.
    => Booting WEBrick
    => Rails 4.2.7.1 application starting in development on http://198.51.100.0:3000
    => Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
    => Ctrl-C to shutdown server
    [2020-03-11 14:17:16] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
    [2020-03-11 14:17:16] INFO  ruby 2.3.3 (2016-11-21) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
    [2020-03-11 14:17:16] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=3089 port=3000
    ```

1.  You can visit your application by visiting the address in the browser.

    ![Rails Welcome Page](rails-welcome-page.png "Rails Welcome Page")

1.  Exit the server process with **Ctrl+C**.

## Create a Controller and View

A controller will receive requests which are then routed and served by various actions. A view displays information.

1.  Create a controller called `Welcome` and an action called `index`:

        rails generate controller Welcome index

    ```output
    create  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
    route   get 'welcome/index'
    invoke  erb
    create    app/views/welcome
    create    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
    invoke  test_unit
    create    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb
    invoke  helper
    create    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb
    invoke    test_unit
    invoke  assets
    invoke    coffee
    create      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.coffee
    invoke    scss
    create      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.scss
    ```

1.  With the text editor of your choice, edit the file `app/views/welcome/index.html.erb` and replace the contents with the following:

    ```file {title="app/views/welcome/index.html.erb" lang="html"}
    <h1>Hello, World! This is Ruby on Rails!</h1>
    ```

1.  Tell Rails where to find the document root. Edit the file `config/routes.rb`, find and uncomment the line root as shown:

    ```file {title="config/routes" lang="conf"}
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      get 'welcome/index'

    ...

      root 'welcome#index'

    ...
    end
    ```

1.  Start the server again:

        rails server --binding=198.51.100.0

    You should see your new welcome page in the web browser.
