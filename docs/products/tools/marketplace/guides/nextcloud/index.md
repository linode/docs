[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is an open source solution to file hosting and sharing. With Nextcloud, you can synchronize files from a local computer to the Linode server and share them with collaborators. Nextcloudâ€™s customizable security features and intuitive user interface help to keep files safe and easy to manage.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Log Into Your Nextcloud Instance

1. Open a browser window and navigate to the NextCloud instance's domain at port 8443 to complete the setup of the server. For example, enter `https://example.com:8443` into the browser, replacing `example.com` with the value of your own domain. If you do not install the App with a domain name, you can use the [Linode's RDNS domain](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#viewing-ip-addresses). For example, `https://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com:8443`. Ensure that save the generated password as you will need that to login to your Nextcloud AIO instance.

1. Click login and enter the generated password set during initial app creation in the presented form.

1. Once you have successfully logged in, the Nextcloud AIO page appears where you can enter the domain you have assigned for this instance. For example, enter `example.com` into the domain name section, replacing `example.com` with the value of your own domain. If you do not install the App with a domain name, you can use the [Linode's RDNS domain](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#viewing-ip-addresses). For example, `203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. 

      ![Nextcloud Domain setup](nextclouddomain.jpg)

1. Now that you've entered the domain, you are now ready to start the Nextcloud containers, click 'Start Containers' and choose any of the addons you'd like to add to your Nextcloud instance.

1. Once the Nextcloud Containers start, you will see the initial Nextcloud username and password as shown in the image below. Please ensure that save the generated password as you will need that to login to your Nextcloud instance. You can click 'Open Your Nextcloud' or visit `https://example.com/login', replacing `example.com` the domain used in previous steps.

## Next Steps

{{< content "marketplace-update-note-shortguide">}}

- [Configure Nextcloud to use Linode Object Storage as an External Storage Mount](/docs/platform/object-storage/how-to-configure-nextcloud-to-use-linode-object-storage-as-an-external-storage-mount/).  You can use Object Storage as a secondary place to store your Nextcloud files. Using Linode Object Storage to store files prevents you from running out of storage space that is limited by your Linode's plan size.
- Install the [Nextcloud desktop synchronization client](https://docs.nextcloud.com/desktop/2.3/installing.html) on a local computer to easily synchronize the desktop files to the Nextcloud server.
