[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is an open source solution to file hosting and sharing. With Nextcloud, you can synchronize files from a local computer to the Linode server and share them with collaborators. Nextcloudâ€™s customizable security features and intuitive user interface help to keep files safe and easy to manage.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Log Into Your Nextcloud Instance

1. Open a browser window and navigate to the NextCloud instance's domain. For example, enter `nextcloud.example.com` into the browser, replacing `example.com` with the value of your own domain. If you do not install the App with a domain name, the domain is the public IP address of the Linode appended with a forward slash and "nextcloud. For example, `192.168.17.43/nextcloud/`.

1. Enter the administrator username and password set during initial app creation in the presented form.

## Next Steps

{{< content "marketplace-update-note-shortguide">}}

- [Configure Nextcloud to use Linode Object Storage as an External Storage Mount](/docs/platform/object-storage/how-to-configure-nextcloud-to-use-linode-object-storage-as-an-external-storage-mount/).  You can use Object Storage as a secondary place to store your Nextcloud files. Using Linode Object Storage to store files prevents you from running out of storage space that is limited by your Linode's plan size.
- Install the [Nextcloud desktop synchronization client](https://docs.nextcloud.com/desktop/2.3/installing.html) on a local computer to easily synchronize the desktop files to the Nextcloud server.
