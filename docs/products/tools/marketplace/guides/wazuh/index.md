[Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) provides a security solution for monitoring your infrastructure and detecting threats, intrusion attempts, system anomalies, poorly configured applications, and unauthorized user actions. It also provides a framework for incident response and regulatory compliance.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Wazuh App

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you created in the beginning of your deployment. You can also use your Compute Instance's rDNS, which may look like `203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing and setting the rDNS value.

1.  In the login screen that appears, enter `admin` as the username and `admin` as the password. Since the default admin user is set to read-only, you need to follow the steps below to reset the admin password.

    1.  Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH. See [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) for assistance.

    1.  Run the Wazuh Password reset tool that has been preloaded onto your instance in the root directory:

            bash /root/wazuh-passwords-tool.sh -a

    1. After the tool finishes running, it outputs all of the new passwords for each system. Record these credentials.

    1. You are now able to log in to your Wazuh instance with your new admin credentials.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your Wazuh instance, you need to configure a [Wazuh Agent](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/index.html) on the server you'd like to monitor with Wazuh.

For more documentation on Wazuh, check out [the official Wazuh documentation](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/index.html) to learn how to further utilize your instance.
