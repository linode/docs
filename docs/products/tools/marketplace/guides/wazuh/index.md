## Getting Started after Deployment

### View Credentials

1.  Log into your new Compute Instance through [LISH](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/) or [SSH](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/set-up-and-secure/#connect-to-the-instance) using the root user and the password you entered when creating the instance.

1.  The usernames and passwords have been saved in a `.deployment-secrets.txt` file located in your root directory. You can view this file in your preferred text editor or through the `cat` command.

    ```command
    cat /root/.deployment-secrets.txt
    ```

    This file contains all of your Wazuh credentials. The admin user and its associated password are needed when following the [Access the Wazuh App](#access-the-wazuh-app) section below.

    ```file {title="/root/.deployment-secrets.txt"}

    ```

### Access the Wazuh App

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you created in the beginning of your deployment. You can also use your Compute Instance's rDNS, which may look like `203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing and setting the rDNS value.

1.  In the login screen that appears, enter `admin` as the username and enter its corresponding password (which can be found by following the [View Credentials](#view-credentials) section).

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your Wazuh instance, you need to configure a [Wazuh Agent](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/index.html) on the server you'd like to monitor with Wazuh.
