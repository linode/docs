## Getting Started after Deployment

Virtualmin is now installed and ready to use.

1.  Before you go to our app, if you filled out the optional Virtualmin configuration fields:

    - In the Cloud Manager [DNS Manager](/docs/products/networking/dns-manager/guides/create-domain/) there is now an entry for your domain with possible subdomain, MX, and SPF records pointing to your new server.
    - [Configure the rDNS](/docs/guides/configure-rdns/) on your Linode.

1.  Virtualmin is served on port 10000, to access it, navigate to either the IP address of your server or to your domain name followed by port 10000. For example, `http://example.com:10000` or `http://203.0.113.0:10000`, replacing the domain name or IP address with values for your server.

1.  At the login screen, login using either:

    - The system root username and password
    - The sudo username and password if you set that up in the Virtualmin optional configuration during installation.

1.  After logging in for the first time, a Post-Installation Wizard walks you through some initial setup to optimize your system. If you choose `Cancel` the wizard will use the default settings.

1.  On the main dashboard, Virtualmin must check its configuration before virtual servers can be added. Click the **Re-check and refresh configuration** button.
