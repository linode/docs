RabbitMQ is a popular open source **message broker**, or a tool that enables and empowers components of a system to communicate from a centralized source or application. By "translating" data from a number of different sources into a unified language, RabbitMQ allows component services to interact with each other through a centralized method.

The RabbitMQ Marketplace App installs a RabbitMQ server and a basic default configuration to assist with messaging tasks. By accessing The RabbitMQ Management console, you can further configure RabbitMQ and view important analytics at any time.
