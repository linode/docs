## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Appwrite Web UI

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://[ip-address]`, where *[ip-address]* is your Compute Instance's IPv4 address. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing IP addresses.

1. You will then be asked to sign into your Appwrite account, or create a new account if you have not signed up already.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your Appwrite instance, check out [the official Appwrite documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs) to learn how to further utilize your instance.
