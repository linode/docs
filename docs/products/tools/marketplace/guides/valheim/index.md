Valheim is an open-world Viking-themed survival and sandbox game developed by [Iron Gate Studio](https://irongatestudio.se/). Play solo in single player mode, or invite your friends for player vs. environment multiplayer mode. With challenging combat, numerous boss battles, and a creative building system that lets you craft things like halls, forts, and even imposing Viking warships, there's always something to do. Explore, build, conquer, and survive. The further you travel the more challenging adventures await.

Install Valheim on Linode with the Valheim Game Server Marketplace App to maximize your gaming experience.

#### SSH Options (Optional)

- **SSH public key for the limited user:** If you wish to login as the limited user through public key authentication (without entering a password), enter your public key here.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Valheim Game Server

After Valheim has finished installing, you can access your server with your Linode's IPv4 address. Copy your Linodeâ€™s IPv4 address from the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com), and then connect to the server within the game using your Linode's IPv4 address and port `2456`(for example `192.0.2.0:2456`).
