- **Email address for the SOA record:** The start of authority (SOA) email address for this server. This is a required field if you want the installer to create DNS records.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Pritunl App

1.  Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH. See [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) for assistance.

1.  Run the command below to obtain your setup key. This key is used in a later step.

        sudo pritunl setup-key

1.  Run the command below to generate the password:

        sudo pritunl default-password

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you created in the beginning of your deployment. If you did not enter a custom domain, use the IP address of the server. You may need to access the self-signed certificate before continuing.

    {{< note >}}
    In Chrome, you can accept the self-signed certificate by clicking on Advanced and then click Proceed to <ip> (unsafe). In Firefox, click on Advanced, then Add Exception, and then Confirm Security Exception.

1.  The Pritunl Database Setup screen appears. Enter the setup key that was generated in a previous step.

1.  The login prompt appears. Enter `pritunl` as the username and then use the password generated in a previous step.

1.  Once you're logged in, you can change the default password and enter the domain information so Pritunl can setup the SSL certificates automatically:
