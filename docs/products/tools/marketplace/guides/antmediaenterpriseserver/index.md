**Software installation should complete within 2-5 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

### Configuration Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/). That said, some options may be limited or recommended based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Ant Media Server App
After Ant Media Server has finished installing, you can access your server with your Linode's IPv4 address. Copy your Linodeâ€™s IPv4 address from the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com), and then connect to the server from your browser using your Linode's IPv4 address and port `5080`(for example `192.0.2.0:5080`).
