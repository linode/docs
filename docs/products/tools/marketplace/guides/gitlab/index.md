[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a complete solution for all aspects of your software development. At its core, GitLab serves as your centralized remote Git repository. GitLab also features built-in tools that represent every task in your development workflow, from planning to testing to releasing.

Self-hosting your software development with GitLab offers total control of your codebase. At the same time, its familiar interface will ease collaboration for you and your team. GitLab is the most popular self-hosted Git repository software, so you'll benefit from a robust set of integrated tools and an active community.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access the GitLab Site

Once your new Compute Instance has been fully deployed, follow the instructions below to access your new Gitlab app.

1. **Find the Gitlab root password:** Before logging in to your Gitlab site, you need to obtain the Gitlab root password that was generated during provisioning.

    1. Log in to your new Compute Instance through [Lish](/docs/guides/lish/) or [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) using either the `root` user or limited user and the associated password you entered when creating the instance.

    1.  Enter the following command in the lish console or terminal session:

            cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password

        The Gitlab root password is displayed within the output of that command.

1. **Log in to your Gitlab site:** Open a web browser and enter either your Compute Instance's default rDNS domain or your domain name (if you entered one during deployment). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing and setting the rDNS value.

    When presented with a login screen, enter the following credentials:

    - **Username:** `root`
    - **Password:** Use the password you obtained in the previous step.

1.  **Reset the root password:** Once you're logged in, it's recommended that you reset the root password. To do so, navigate to the following URL, replacing *[domain]* with the rDNS domain of your Compute instance or your custom domain:

        https://[domain]/-/profile/password/edit

You can now begin creating GitLab repositories, users, and more. See [GitLab's official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/university/training/topics/getting_started.html) for more information.
