## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Gitea Site

After Gitea has finished installing, you can access your Gitea site using a web browser to complete setup and begin using your app.

1.  Enter your Linode's fully qualified domain name (for example, `https://www.example.com`) or [IPv4 address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/) (for example, `http://192.0.2.0`) into a browser window to access the Gitea welcome page. Select the **Register** link to reach the initial configuration screen.
