## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing Haltdos Community WAF

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://[ip-address]:9000/`, where *[ip-address]* can be replaced with your Compute Instance's IPv4 address or rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing IP addresses and rDNS.

    {{< note type="warning" >}}
    Haltdos uses a self-signed TLS/SSL certificate. It is likely that your web browser will display a security warning. You need to accept this risk and bypass the warning to continue.
