[Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/) is a multiplayer game where you play as a survivor that must work with or against other players to ensure your own survival. Players are able to steal, lie, cheat, or trick each other. You can build a shelter, hunt animals for food, craft weapons, craft armor, and much more.

Hosting your own Rust server allows you to customize settings and curate the number of players in the world.

## Getting Started after Deployment

Ensure that you have installed Rust to your computer before getting started with this section. You can install Rust from [Steam's Web Store](https://store.steampowered.com/).

After the Rust Marketplace App has finished deploying to your Linode, you will be able to access your Rust server by copying your Linode's IPv4 address and entering it in to the Rust game installed on your computer. To find your Linode's IPv4 address:

1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the sidebar. You will see a list of all your Linodes.

2. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

3. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

4. Under the **IPv4** heading, you will find your IPv4 address listed under the **Address** column.

5. Copy the IPv4 address. Open Rust, and then open the developer's console by pressing `f1`.

6. In the console, type `connect 192.0.2.155:28015` and replace 192.0.2.155 with your Linode's IP address. Be sure append the port `28015` to the end of the IP address. Press **enter** when you are done typing.

    You will be logged into the server, and the game will load.
