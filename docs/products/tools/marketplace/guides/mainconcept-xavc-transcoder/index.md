The [MainConcept XAVC Transcoder](https://www.mainconcept.com/transcoders) from the Pro Camera Transcoders for Sony & Panasonic product line is an optimized Docker container for file-based transcoding to professional Sony camera formats such as XAVC-Intra, XAVC Long GOP, and XAVC-S. MainConcept XAVC Transcoder supports a wide range of input formats, and is ready-to-use out of the box. It can be controlled via command line, REST API, or various container management tools.

The XAVC Transcoder includes MainConcept's codecs, pre-packaged as a single, optimized containerized application for fast and flexible deployment to any workflow as a service or direct Compute Instance.

This version of the XAVC Transcoder is a free version that demonstrates how MainConcept codecs and related libraries work and perform in a cloud environment. It adds a watermark to processed video and intermittently mutes audio. If you wish to deploy the full version of the XAVC Transcoder, please visit the [MainConcept on Linode](https://www.mainconcept.com/akamai-linode) website.

## Getting Started after Deployment

Once all packages have been installed, MainConcept XAVC Transcoder is ready to receive API requests. The REST API does not require authentication. API functions use the following syntax:

```command
http://CONTAINER_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/rest/API_VERSION/FUNCTION/PARAMETERS
```

In the URL above, `API_VERSION` only contains the major version, and should be formatted using a leading "v". For example, the API version for MainConcept XAVC Transcoder v2.0 is "v1". Additionally, if you choose to use a custom domain, replace instances of `IP_ADDRESS` with the domain you entered. See example functions below:

- Get service name: `GET http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/rest/v1/service`

- Get transcoding jobs: `GET http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/rest/v1/jobs`

- Get details on a specific job: `GET http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/rest/v1/jobs/JOB_ID`

- Start transcoding job: `POST http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/rest/v1/jobs`

Below is an example of a **job description file** body formatted in JSON:

```file
{
  "INPUT": "ftp://10.144.41.202:2121/test.mp4",
  "OUTPUT": "ftp://10.144.41.202:2121/test/xavc_intra.mxf",
  "PRESETNAME": "XAVC_Intra_HD_CBG_50",
  "KEEP_CONTENT": "TRUE",
  "VERBOSITY": "DEFAULT"
}
```

Parameters for various options can be configured by editing the `properties.txt` file.
