## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your ClusterControl App

To access your ClusterControl instance, Open a browser and navigate to the domain you created during in the beginning of your deployment or your Linode rDNS domain `https://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. Replace `https://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com` with your [Linode's RDNS domain](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#viewing-ip-addresses).

From there you will see the welcome screen where you can enter the requested information to setup your ClusterControl instance:
