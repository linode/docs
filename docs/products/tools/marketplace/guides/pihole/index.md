[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is a [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wikic/DNS_sinkhole) that filters out requests to ad-serving domains, blocking ads and improving network performance. With Pi-hole, you can actively monitor every DNS request made on your network and block requests as they come in.

- **Email address for the SOA record:** The start of authority (SOA) email address for this server. This is a required field if you want the installer to create DNS records.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Pi-hole App

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://[domain]/admin`, where *[domain]* can be replaced with the custom domain you entered during deployment, your Compute Instance's rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`), or your IPv4 address. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing IP addresses and rDNS.

    The Pi-Hole dashboard should now be displayed.
