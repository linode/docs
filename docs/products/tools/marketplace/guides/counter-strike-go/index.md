[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) (CS:GO) is a fast-paced first person shooter. Teams compete against each other to complete objectives or to eliminate the opposing team. A competitive match requires two teams of five players, but hosting your own server offers you control over team size and server location, so you and your friends can play with low latency. Up to 64 players can be hosted on a single server.

This Marketplace App deploys the CS:GO server software through [LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com/). While no additional license is required to run the server, each client needs to have a license for the game.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Connect with the CS:GO Client

After CS:GO has finished installing, you will be able to access your game server by connecting to its IP address. To find your Linode's IPv4 address:

1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) sidebar. You will see a list of all your Linodes.

1. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

1. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

1. Your IPv4 address will be listed under the **Address** column in the **IPv4** table.

1. Copy the IPv4 address.

1. In CS:GO, use the back tick key (**&#96;**) to open the developer's console. If pressing the back tick key does not bring up the developer's console, you might need to enable it in the settings. Under *Game Settings* choose **Enable Developer's Console** and select **Yes**:

1. In the CS:GO developer's console, type `connect 192.0.2.240` and click **Submit**, where `192.0.2.240` is the IP address of your Linode.

    {{< note >}}
    If you included a **CS:GO Server Password** in your [CS:GO Options](#cs-go-options) when installing, submit `connect 192.0.2.240; password your_server_password` instead.
