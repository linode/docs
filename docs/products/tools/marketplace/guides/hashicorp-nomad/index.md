[HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) is a simple and flexible scheduler and orchestrator to deploy and manage containers and non-containerized applications across cloud platforms (and on-premises servers) at scale.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** Nomad should be fully installed within 5-10 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Debian 11
- **Recommended plan:** We recommend a 4GB Dedicated CPU or Shared Compute instance for the Nomad Server. Nomad Clients (deployed separately from this Marketplace App) can use plans of any size.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Nomad Web UI

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://[ip-address]:8080`, where *[ip-address]* is your Compute Instance's IPv4 address. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing IP addresses.

1. The [Nomad Web UI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/nomad/web-ui) is displayed. From here, you can manage the cluster, jobs, integrations, and ACL tokens.

    {{< note >}}
    HashiCorp recommends using mutual TLS (mTLS) with a private CA to secure cluster communications and the web UI. Please see the following HashiCorp documentation for more details.

1. Additional configurations are required to use the Linode Marketplace Nomad Server in a production environment. We recommend reviewing the [Configuration](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/configuration) and [Job Spec](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification) documentation before proceeding.
