A MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack is a free and open-source web software bundle used to build modern web applications:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document database used to persist your application's data.

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) serves as the web application framework.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is used to build your application's user interfaces using JavaScript. React offers a server-side rendering function which makes it easier for search engines to crawl your web application.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) serves as the run-time environment for your application.

All of these technologies are well-established, offer robust feature sets, and are well-supported by their maintaining organizations. These characteristics make them a great choice for your applications. Upload your existing MERN website code to your new Linode, or use MERN's scaffolding tool to start writing new web applications on the Linode.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Debian 10, Debian 11, and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended minimum plan:** 1GB Shared Compute Instance or higher, depending on the number of sites and size of the sites you plan on hosting.

## Getting Started After Deployment

After your MERN One-click App has finished installing, you can:

- [Connect to your Linode via SSH](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/#connect-to-the-instance). You need your Linode's root password to proceed.

- Consult the following guides to learn more about working with the various components of the MERN stack:

    - [Build Database Clusters with MongoDB](/docs/guides/build-database-clusters-with-mongodb/)
    - [Deploy a React Application on Linode](/docs/guides/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-on-debian-10/)

## Software Included

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MongoDB** | Document-based database |
| **Express** | Web application framework |
| **React** | JavaScript library |
| **Node JS** | Runtime environment |
| **UFW (UncomplicatedFirewall)** | Firewall utility. Ports 22/tcp for IPv4 and IPv6 allows incoming traffic. All other ports have the following firewall rules: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing). |
