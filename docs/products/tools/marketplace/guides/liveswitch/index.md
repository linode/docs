1. The *Welcome* setup wizard is displayed. Follow the prompts in this wizard to input your license key and create your user.

1. After completing the setup wizard, you should see the main Configuration Console for your installation. To learn more about how to manage your instance, see the [Configuration Console documentation](https://developer.liveswitch.io/liveswitch-server/server/configuration/configuration-console.html).
