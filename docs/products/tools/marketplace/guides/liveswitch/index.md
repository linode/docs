LiveSwitch Server requires a license to use the software. A free 30 day trial license is available, in addition to paid licenses. The instructions in this section walk you through the process of obtaining a trial license. To learn more about the other license options that are available to you, [contact LiveSwitch](https://www.liveswitch.io/get-started?hsLang=en) directly.

1. Navigate to the [LiveSwitch Cloud free trial webpage](https://www.liveswitch.io/build-webrtc-apps-free-trial?hsLang=en) and complete the trial form. While you will not utilize the free trial for the Cloud product, this enables you to create an account which will be used in the next step.

1. Navigate to [Frozen Mountain's account page](https://www.frozenmountain.com/account) and sign in using the credentials you created in the previous step. Note that Frozen Mountain was the prior name of the company before it was renamed to LiveSwitch in 2021.

1. Click the **Downloads** link on the top right.
