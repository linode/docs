[LiveSwitch Server](https://www.liveswitch.io/products/liveswitch-server) is a self-hosted WebRTC live video streaming platform. It provides high quality and reliable streaming for both audio and video media. Here's more from the publisher:

> LiveSwitch is the most flexible video and audio WebRTC SDK on the market. Ultra-low latency meets advanced features for engaging with your audience. LiveSwitch offers a complete solution (front-end and back-end) to develop commercial WebRTC applications.

This Marketplace App deploys a back-end demonstration server, running signalling, media, and TURN together on a single server. It is designed to be tested alongside the official client SDKs for .NET, .NET Core, iOS, Android, Xamarin, Maui, Unity and more. To download these SDKs, see the [Client SDK](https://developer.liveswitch.io/liveswitch-server/guides/intro.html) page on the LiveSwitch Developer documentation site.
