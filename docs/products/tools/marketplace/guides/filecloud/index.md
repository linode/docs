## Getting Started after Deployment

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `https://[domain]/admin`, where *[domain]* can be replaced with the custom domain you entered during deployment or your Compute Instance's rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). You can also use your IPv4 address. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing IP addresses and rDNS.

1.  In the login fields that appear,the default username is *admin*, and the password can be found in the credentials file located in /home/$USERNAME/.credentials.

### Obtain a new License Key

FileCloud by default is inaccessible without either a trial or paid license key provided by FileCloud.

1. To obtain a trial license key, sign on or create an account at [FileCloud's customer portal](https://portal.getfilecloud.com/ui/user/index.html). After logging in to your new account, click on the **Begin Trial** button and follow the prompts to obtain a new trial license key file.See [FileCloud - License Purchase And Renewal](https://www.getfilecloud.com/supportdocs/display/cloud/FileCloud+-+License+Purchase+And+Renewal) for full instructions on obtaining a license.

1. Once you have a valid license key, log in to the FileCloud administrator page. After a new successful login, a message should be displayed notifying you that the license is invalid. If this message is not visible, navigate to **Settings** > **License**.

1. Click the **Choose File** button to upload your `license.xlm` file and register your license key with this FileCloud installation.
