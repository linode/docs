[Yacht](https://yacht.sh/) is a web interface for managing Docker containers, with an emphasis on templating to provide easy deployments. The ultimate goal of Yacht is to make Docker easy for anyone to use and manage with templates, template variables, and an intuitive UI.

{{< note type="alert" >}}
Keep in mind, Yacht is still in alpha and is not recommended for production use.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

{{< content "marketplace-verify-standard-shortguide">}}

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** Yacht should be fully installed within 2-5 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Debian 11, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Recommended minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

### Yacht Options

- **Yacht Email:** The email address for your Yacht login. The default is admin@yacht.local.
- **Yacht Password** *(required)* The password for your Yacht login.
- **Yacht Compose Support:** Support for using Yacht with [Docker Compose](https://yacht.sh/Advanced/docker-compose/). - **Yacht Theme:** Yacht theme options: Default, RED, and OMV.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Yacht App

1. After Yacht has finished installing, you can access your Yacht instance by visiting your [Linode's IP address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/) at port 8000 (for example, `http://192.0.2.0:8000`) in a web browser.

    {{< note type="alert" >}}
    By default Yacht is not configured to use SSL, meaning that your login credentials will be sent over plain text. See [Additional Steps for SSL](#additional-steps-for-ssl) for guidance on how to encrypt your connection.
    {{< /note >}}

1. Enter your [Yacht email address and password](#yacht-options):

    You should see the Yacht administration panel:

Yacht provides elegant theme customization, templating, easy management of Docker resources (volumes, images, network), applications and projects. Click the page icon on the bottom-left corner to view a live demo and official [Yacht documentation](https://yacht.sh/).

### Additional Steps for SSL

Since Yacht is not configured for SSL, some additional steps are required to encrypt your connection. The following example uses [self-signed SSL certificates](/docs/guides/create-a-self-signed-tls-certificate/), but this can also work with a [commercially signed](/docs/guides/obtain-a-commercially-signed-tls-certificate/) or [Let's Encrypt certificates](/docs/guides/install-lets-encrypt-to-create-ssl-certificates/) if the server is configured with a FQDN.

1. Login to the Linode's IP over `ssh`. Replace `192.0.2.0` with your [Linode's IP address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/).

    ```command
    ssh root@192.0.2.0
    ```

1. Create two local directories for SSL and the modified `nginx.conf`.

    ```command
    mkdir -p local/nginx
    mkdir local/ssl
    ```

1. Create the self-signed certificate and key.

    ```command
    openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out yacht.crt -keyout yacht.key
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following:

    ```output
    Generating a RSA private key
    ...............................................................................................................................................+
    ......................++++
    writing new private key to 'yacht.key'
    -----
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Pennsylvania
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:Philadelphia
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:yacht.local
    Email Address []:admin@yacht.local
    ```

1. Move the newly generated certificate and key into the `local/ssl` directory.

    ```command
    mv yacht.* local/ssl
    ```

1. Dump the Yacht `nginx.conf` to the `local/nginx` directory.

    ```command
    docker exec -it yacht /bin/sh -c "cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf" > local/nginx/nginx.conf
    ```

1. Open the `local/nginx/nginx.conf` file using `vim` or another text editor of your choice and locate the server block for port 8000 (around line 30).

    ```file {title="local/nginx/nginx.conf"}
    ...
    server {
        listen *:8000;
    ...
    ```

     Add the `ssl` parameter and paths for the certificate and key.

    ```file {title="local/nginx/nginx.conf" lang="conf"}
      ...
      server {
          listen *:8000 ssl;
          ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/yacht.crt;
          ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/yacht.key;

      ...
      ```

1. Copy `local/nginx/nginx.conf` and `local/ssl` to the `/etc/nginx/` directory in the Yacht container, and then reload Nginx.

    ```command
    docker cp local/nginx/nginx.conf yacht:/etc/nginx/
    docker cp local/ssl yacht:/etc/nginx/

    # remove ^M characters
    docker exec -it yacht /bin/sh -c "sed -ie 's/\r//g' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf"

    # reload nginx
    docker exec -it yacht /bin/sh -c "nginx -s reload"
    ```

Your browser may give warnings because the certificate is not signed by a Certificate Authority, and require you to add a security exception, but the connection is now encrypted.
