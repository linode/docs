## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Getting Started after Deployment

The Cloudron application is served on the Linode, however it still requires a few additional steps to fully complete the installation process.

1.  The Cloudron setup wizard is served at the IP address of the Linode server . For example, `http://203.0.113.0 `, replacing the IP address with values for the Linode server and accept the self-signed certificate.

    {{< note >}}
    In Chrome, you can accept the self-signed certificate by clicking on Advanced and then click Proceed to <ip> (unsafe). In Firefox, click on Advanced, then Add Exception and then Confirm Security Exception.
