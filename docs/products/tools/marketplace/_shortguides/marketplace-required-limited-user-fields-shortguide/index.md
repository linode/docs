#### Limited Sudo User

You can fill out the following fields to automatically create a limited sudo user for your new Compute Instance. This account will be assigned to the *sudo* group, which provides elevated permissions when running commands with the `sudo` prefix.

- **Limited sudo user:** Enter your preferred username for the limited user. *No Capital Letters, Spaces, or Special Characters*
- **SSH public key for the limited user:** If you wish to login as the limited user through public key authentication (without entering a password), enter your public key here. See [Creating an SSH Key Pair and Configuring Public Key Authentication on a Server](/docs/guides/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) for instructions on generating a key pair.
- **Disable root access over SSH:** To block the root user from logging in over SSH, select *Yes* (recommended). You can still switch to the root user once logged in, and you can also log in as root through [Lish](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).

{{< note type="warning" title="Locating Your Sudo Password As Root">}}
If you disable root access for your deployment and do not enter a valid SSH public key, you will need to login as the root user via the [Lish console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/) and locate the credentials file found at `/root/.credentials` to obtain the limited sudo user password.
