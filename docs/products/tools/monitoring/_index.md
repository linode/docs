## Features

### Performance Monitoring
See how your Linodes are performing now and historically over time. Know when to scale up or down for better application performance.

### Custom Thresholds
Create custom usage threshold alerts so you know when youâ€™re close to exceeding resources and know when it's time to scale up your resources. See the [Monitoring and Maintaining your Server](/docs/uptime/monitoring/monitoring-and-maintaining-your-server/#configure-linode-cloud-manager-email-alerts) guide for instruction on how to configure custom email alerts for CPU usage, Disk IO rate, and more.

### Shutdown Watchdog
When enabled, our Shutdown Watchdog automatically reboots your Linode if it should ever power off unexpectedly. "Lassie," as it's also known, gets your Linode back online before you even know it's off.

## Pricing

Linode's Monitoring is provided for free to all customers.
