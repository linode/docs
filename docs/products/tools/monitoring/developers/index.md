## Linode API

Linodeâ€™s [API v4](/docs/api) provides the ability to programmatically manage the full range of Linode products and services.

- [View Linode Statistics](/docs/api/linode-instances/#view-linode-statistics)

- [View Statistics (year/month)](/docs/api/linode-instances/#view-statistics-yearmonth)

- [List Managed Stats](/docs/api/managed/#list-managed-stats)

- [View NodeBalancer Statistics](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#view-nodebalancer-statistics)

- [Longview Endpoints](/docs/api/longview/)

## Linode CLI

The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that allows you to manage your Linode account and resources from the command line.
