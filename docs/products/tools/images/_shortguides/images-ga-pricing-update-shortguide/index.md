**Pricing change:** On September 1, 2021, Custom Images transitioned to a paid service with a cost of $0.10/GB per month for each Custom Image stored on an account. Recovery Images, generated automatically after a Compute Instance is deleted, will continue to be provided at no cost. See [Images > Pricing](/docs/products/tools/images/#pricing) for additional details.
