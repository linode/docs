The Images service has been updated with enhanced features, including expanded size limits and the ability to [Upload an Image](/docs/products/tools/images/guides/upload-an-image/) (a new feature that's currently in beta). Images will continue to be available at no charge until September 1st, 2021, at which point it will transition to a paid service. Additional details and pricing information are available on the [Images Overview](/docs/products/tools/images/) page.
