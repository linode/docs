{{< note >}}
The Images service has been updated to include expanded size limits and the ability to [Upload an Image](/docs/products/tools/images/guides/upload-an-image/) (this feature is currently in beta). Images will remain free of charge during the beta and transition to a paid service at a future date.  Additional details and pricing information are available on the [Images](https://www.linode.com/products/images/) product page.
