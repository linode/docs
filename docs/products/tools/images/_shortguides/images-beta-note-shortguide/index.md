{{< note >}}
We're expanding our Images product with the functionality to upload an image file. This functionality is currently in beta and available to users of our [Green Light](https://www.linode.com/green-light/) program. The current functionality to create Images from a Linode's disk and deploy those Images to new or existing Linodes will remain. While Images are free to use now, the price for all Images will increase to $0.05/GB per month once the updated Images product is officially released.
