The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the [Linode API](/docs/products/tools/api/), which gives you the ability to manage your Linode account from the command line. Almost any task that can be done through the Cloud Manager can also be performed through the CLI.

## Features

### Accelerate Common Tasks

Running common tasks is trivial with the Linode CLI. Create Linodes and NodeBalancers, and attach block or object storage volumes without leaving your terminal.

### Customizable Output

The Linode CLI prints easily readable output by default. You can also specify which fields are returned by the CLI and request JSON responses.

### Easy Scripting

Everything you can do with the Linode Cloud Manager can be done through the CLI. The Linode CLI has an easy-to-use interface that makes it perfect for scripting.

## Availability

The Linode CLI can be used across [all regions](https://www.linode.com/global-infrastructure/).

## Pricing

The Linode CLI is provided for free to all customers.
