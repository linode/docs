{{< note type="warning" title="Consider Using Akamai's New Metadata Service" >}}
Akamai's Metadata service is now available in select data centers and should be considered for new projects as an alternative to StackScripts. Use Metadata to automate system configuration by adding directives or scripts when deploying Compute Instances. This user data can then be consumed by cloud-init, an industry standard system initialization tool, or accessed directly using the Metadata API. For instructions on using the Metadata service and for a list of supported regions and distributions, reference our [documentation](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/).
