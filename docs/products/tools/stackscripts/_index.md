### A Library of StackScripts

Customize your Linode with one of the many StackScripts in our library or discover a community-sourced script. They include everything from installing a Linode-optimized LAMP stack to configuring an IPsec VPN server.

### Create Your Own

Writing new StackScripts is simple. If you canâ€™t find the right StackScript for your Linode, author your own using our [StackScripts guides](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/stackscripts/).
