## View StackScripts

Log in to the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) and select **StackScripts** from the left menu. If any StackScripts exist on your account, they are listed on this page.

The **Account StackScripts** tab includes all of your account StackScripts, including those that are public. The **Community StackScripts** tab lists all StackScripts that are public, including those from other users.

Each StackScript is displayed along with the username of user that created it, its label, and a brief description. There is also a corresponding table row for the last revision and the number of Compute Instances that have been deployed using the StackScript.

## Create a New StackScript

See [Create a StackScript](/docs/products/tools/stackscripts/guides/create/) for instructions.

1. The **Edit StackScript** page appears, which is similar to the **Create StackScript** form that's discussed within the [Create a StackScript](/docs/products/tools/stackscripts/guides/create/) guide. From here, you can update any field - including the script.

1. Add a brief description of your changes to the **Revision Note** field and click the **Save Changes** button.

## Make a StackScript Public

Making an Account StackScript public allows the rest of the Linode community to access your script as a *Community StackScript*.

1. Navigate to the **StackScripts** page in the Cloud Manager. See [View StackScripts](#view-stackscripts).

1. Locate the StackScript you wish to view or edit. Click on the corresponding **Make StackScript Public** link, which may appear within the ellipsis menu.

1. A dialog box appears asking you to confirm that you wish to make the StackScript public.

    {{< note type="alert" >}}
    While you can edit a public *Community StackScript*, you cannot delete it or make it private again.
    {{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
Your public [Account StackScript](/docs/products/tools/stackscripts/guides/deploy-a-compute-instance/#account-stackscripts) is available to you for use on the Account StackScripts tab. For users on other accounts, your StackScript is available to them from the [Community StackScripts](/docs/products/tools/stackscripts/guides/deploy-a-compute-instance/#community-stackscripts) tab.
