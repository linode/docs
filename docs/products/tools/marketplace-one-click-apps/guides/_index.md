## Building Blocks

Review these introductory guides to Linode’s Marketplace Apps to get up and running with the service.

### Marketplace Basics

- [Deploying an App](/docs/products/tools/marketplace-one-click-apps/guides/marketplace-deploy-app): Quickly deploy an app from the Cloud Manager.

- [Access Your App](/docs/products/tools/marketplace-one-click-apps/guides/marketplace-access-app): Access to your application depends on what you deployed, but the app's IP address is likely required. Here’s how you find it.

- [Add a Domain Name](/docs/products/tools/marketplace-one-click-apps/guides/marketplace-add-domain-name): Add a domain name for your application.

See the guide [Using Linode’s Marketplace Apps](/docs/platform/marketplace/how-to-use-marketplace-apps-at-linode/) for more on getting started.
