## Linode API

Marketplace applications are deployed in the API via the
[StackScripts Endpoint Collection](/docs/api/stackscripts).

## Linode CLI

 The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that allows you to manage your Linode account and resources from the command line.
