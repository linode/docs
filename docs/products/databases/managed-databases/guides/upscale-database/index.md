You can upscale database clusters to adapt them to your needs. Upscaling works only within the already selected instance type; if your cluster uses Shared CPU, you can only select an upscaled Shared CPU plan. Clusters canâ€™t be downscaled.

This operation causes downtime for the upscaled node clusters.
