The functionality of PostgreSQL can be enhanced through the use of extensions. Linode's PostgreSQL Managed Database service supports many of these extensions and they are available for any user to install and utilize.

{{< caution >}}
Since superuser access is not available within our PostgreSQL Managed Databases, some extensions may not work as expected.
{{</ caution >}}

## View Available Extensions

To see a full list of all the extensions available for your version of PostgreSQL, connect to your database and run the following query. You can also review the [List of Available Extensions](#list-of-available-extensions) below.

    SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;

## Install an Extension

To install one of the available extensions on your database, use the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command, replacing *[extension_name]* with the name of the extension you wish to install.

    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS [extension_name];

## Remove an Extension

To remove an extension, use the [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html) command, replacing *[extension_name]* with the name of the extension you wish to install.

    DROP EXTENSION [extension_name];

## List of Available Extensions

The table below lists all of the PostgreSQL extensions that are supported by our Managed Database service. Note that not all extensions are supported on all PostreSQL versions. Furthermore, the actual installed version of the extension itself may vary between PostgreSQL versions.

{{< note >}}
While this list is kept updated, the most recent and accurate list can be generated through the instructions in the [View Available Extensions](#view-available-extensions) section.
