The functionality of PostgreSQL can be enhanced through the use of [extensions](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Extensions). Linode's PostgreSQL Managed Database service supports many of these extensions.

## Manage Extensions

Many extensions can be viewed, installed, and removed directly from the PostgreSQL command-line prompt. To access this prompt, connect to your database using the psql tool. See [Connect to a PostgreSQL Database > psql](/docs/products/databases/managed-databases/guides/postgresql-connect/#connect-using-psql-cli).

### View Installed Extensions

To view the extensions that are currently installed on your PostgreSQL Managed Database, run the `\dx` command at the prompt. The output should be similar to the following, displaying each extension along with its version number, schema, and a short description.

```output
     Name      | Version |   Schema   |          Description
---------------+---------+------------+--------------------------------
 plpgsql       | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
```

### View Available Extensions

To see a full list of all the extensions available for your version of PostgreSQL, run the following query. You can also review the [List of Available Extensions](#list-of-available-extensions) below.

    SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;

{{< note type="alert" >}}
Linode does not provide superuser access to PostgreSQL Managed Databases. As such, some extensions may not function properly or may otherwise encounter permissions issues.

### Install an Extension

To install one of the available extensions on your database, use the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command, replacing *[extension_name]* with the name of the extension you wish to install.

    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS [extension_name];

If this command does not work, the extension may either not be compatible or it may need to be manually enabled on your Managed Database by our team. Review the [extensions list](#list-of-available-extensions) below.

### Remove an Extension

To remove an extension, use the [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html) command, replacing *[extension_name]* with the name of the extension you wish to install.

    DROP EXTENSION [extension_name];

## List of Available Extensions

The table below lists all of the PostgreSQL extensions that may be supported by our Managed Database service, along with the compatible PostgreSQL versions.

{{< note type="alert" >}}
Linode does not provide superuser access to PostgreSQL Managed Databases. As such, some extensions may not function properly or may otherwise encounter permissions issues. Extensions that are known not to work, such as `adminpack`, have been marked as incompatible in the list below. If you encounter an extension that isn't working as expected due to permissions issues, our team can review the extension. Reach out to [Support](https://www.linode.com/support/) with the extension name, the name of the database for which you wish to use the extension, and your use case.
