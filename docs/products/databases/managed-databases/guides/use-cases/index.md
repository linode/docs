Managed Databases is Linode's own Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platform. These types of database services allow organizations to offload their database infrastructure and management so they can focus on their own applications and services. This guide discusses the use cases and benefits for Managed Databases.

## Cost Reduction

Hosting your own database on-premise (or on your own custom cloud architecture) can require you to dedicate a significant budget and lots of IT resources towards its implementation and operation. Offloading this to a dedicated DBaaS solution like Managed Databases has the potential to significantly lower the cost and reduce the complexity. This allows you to focus on your business - not your computing infrastructure.

## Rapid Deployment

It's often necessary to create short-lived databases quickly and securely. You may want to do this for development, disaster recovery (discussed below), ephemeral applications, traffic management, and much more. Managed Databases makes this process incredibly efficient, allowing you to create databases quickly using the Cloud Manager or programmatically through the Linode API.

## Disaster Recovery

Every organization should have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in place to safeguard their data. Every Managed Database provides daily backups that are retained for 7 days and can be restored through a click of a button. This provides an additional layer of data protection on top of your existing strategy. In addition, since Managed Databases can be provisioned quickly, you're able to use this service as part of a disaster recovery plan for on-premise or self-hosted databases.

## High Availability

Most production applications would greatly benefit from the redundancy and extreme uptime that high availability solutions offer. Managed Databases, when configured with 3 nodes, provides built-in data replication, redundancy, and automatic failover. This ensures downtime is significantly minimized and applications are always available.
