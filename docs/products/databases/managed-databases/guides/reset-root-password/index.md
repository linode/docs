If you need to reset the root password on your Managed Database, you can do so through the Cloud Manager. This process assigns a new randomly generated password to the `linroot` user. This is helpful when someone should no longer have access to that user or if you believe your password may have been compromised.

Resetting the root password will prevent you from restoring all previously taken backups. Ensure that you have offsite backups available if needed.
