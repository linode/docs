PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database management system that can use either SQL or JSON queries. It's generally more flexible and feature-rich than MySQL, though it's not a drop-in replacement and applications need to have built-in support for it. See [An Introduction to PostgreSQL](/docs/guides/an-introduction-to-postgresql/). The following releases are available:

- PostgreSQL 13.2
- PostgreSQL 12.6
- PostgreSQL 11.11
- PostgreSQL 10.14
