As part of the Managed Database service, the database cluster is updated regularly. This includes security updates and patches for the underlying operating system. These updates occur on a user-configurable *maintenance window*. By default, the maintenance window is set to start *every week* on *Sunday* at *20:00 UTC* and lasts for 3 hours.

{{< note type="alert" >}}
If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance window when any updates occur. It's recommended that you adjust this window to match a time that will be the least disruptive for your application and users. You may also want to consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.

**The database software is not updated automatically.** To upgrade to a new version (such as from MySQL 5.7.30 or 8.0.25 to 8.0.26), consider deploying a new Managed Database with the version you wish to use. You can then [migrate your databases](/docs/products/databases/managed-databases/guides/migrate-mysql/) from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.
