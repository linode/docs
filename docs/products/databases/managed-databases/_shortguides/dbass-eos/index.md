{{< note type="warning" title="Managed Database Availability">}}
As part of our ongoing commitment to innovation and better serving our customers, we have made the strategic decision to pause the sale of our Managed Database offering for all customers who do not have an active database deployed. We recognize the need for a product that offers higher performance and the capacity to handle more complex workloads.

If you have an existing database already deployed, you will continue to be able to deploy, provision, and manage the service exactly as you do today, and weâ€™ll fully support your Managed Database workloads until our next-generation database solution is available. For future news and announcements related to Managed Databases, [please sign up using the form on our product page](/products/databases/).
