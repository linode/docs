{{< note type="warning" title="Password requirements and recommendations" isCollapsible=true >}}
Account passwords must be a minimum of 11 characters in length and be sufficiently complex. Each password is individually analyzed by an algorithmic tool to determine it's strength. When creating a password, follow the recommendations listed below:

- Password should be _at least_ 11 characters in length (though longer passwords are considered stronger).
- Avoid using simple passwords based on dictionary words.
- Use a mixture of unpredictable uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid repeating characters (`aaa`), sequences (`abcd`), and keyboard patterns (`qwerty`).
