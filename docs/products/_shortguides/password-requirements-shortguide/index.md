{{< note type="warning" title="Password requirements and recommendations" isCollapsible=true >}}
Passwords must be a minimum of 11 characters in length and sufficiently complex as to not be realistically guessable. While there are no exact conditions needed to meet the level of complexity that's required, here are some recommendations:

- Avoid using simple passwords based on dictionary words
- Use a mixture of unpredictable uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid repeating characters (`aaa`), sequences (`abcd`), and keyboard patterns (`qwerty`)
