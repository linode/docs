Scientists, artists, and engineers need access to significant parallel computational power. Linode offers GPU-optimized virtual machines accelerated by the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000, harnessing the power of CUDA, Tensor, and RT cores to execute complex processing, deep learning, and ray tracing workloads.

**GPU plans are ideal for highly specialized workloads that would benefit from dedicated NVIDIA GPUs, including machine learning, AI, and data/graphics processing.**

## On-demand

Between purchasing, installing, and maintaining GPUs, the cost of ownership is often high. Linode GPUs allow you to leverage the power of GPUs while benefiting from the main value proposition of cloud: turning a CapEx into an OpEx.

## Market Leading Hardware

Linode GPUs are NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 units, currently considered one of the best in market GPUs. With CUDA, Tensor, and RT cores in each unit, these GPUs support any use cases associated with parallel processing, deep learning, or ray tracing.

One GPU card isnâ€™t enough for your projected workloads? Not a problem. Linode GPU plans offer up to four cards per instance, depending on how much horsepower you need.

## Dedicated Competition-Free Resources

A GPU Compute Instance's vCPU cores are dedicated and accessible only to you. Because the vCPU cores are not shared, no other Compute Instances can utilize them. Your instance never has to wait for another process, enabling your software to run at peak speed and efficiency. This allows you to run workloads that require full-duty work (100% CPU all day, every day) at peak performance.

## Recommended Workloads

GPU Compute Instances are suitable for specialized workloads that are optimized for GPUs:

- Machine learning and AI
- Big data processing
- Video encoding
- Graphics processing

See the [Use Cases for Linode GPU Instances](/docs/products/compute/gpu/guides/use-cases/) guide to learn more about these use cases.
