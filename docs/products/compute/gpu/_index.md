## Features

### On-demand

Between purchasing, installing, and maintaining GPUs, the cost of ownership is often high. Linode GPUs allow you to leverage the power of GPUs while benefiting from the main value proposition of cloud: turning a CapEx into an OpEx.

### Market Leading Hardware

Linode GPUs are NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 units, currently considered one of the best in market GPUs. With CUDA, Tensor, and RT cores in each unit, these GPUs support any use cases associated with parallel processing, deep learning, or ray tracing.

One GPU card isnâ€™t enough for your projected workloads? Not a problem. Linode GPU plans offer up to four cards per instance, depending on how much horsepower you need.
