| Instance Type | CPU | Overview |
| -- | -- | -- |
| [**Shared CPU Instance**](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/plans/shared-cpu/) | Shared | **1 GB - 192 GB Memory, 1 - 32 vCPUs, 25 GB - 3840 GB Storage**<br>[Starting at $5/mo ($0.0075/hour)](https://www.linode.com/pricing/#compute-shared)<br><br>Offers a balanced array of resources coupled with shared CPUs, which keeps costs down while still supporting a wide variety of cloud applications.<br><br>*Best for development servers, staging servers, low traffic web applications, and almost any modern web application.* |
| [**Dedicated CPU Instance**](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/plans/dedicated-cpu/) | Dedicated | **4 GB - 512 GB Memory, 2 - 64 vCPUs, 80 GB - 7200 GB Storage**<br>[Starting at $30/mo ($0.045/hour)](https://www.linode.com/pricing/#compute-dedicated)<br><br>Equipped with Dedicated CPUs, which provide competition free guaranteed CPU resources. Perfectly balanced for most production applications.<br><br>*Best for production websites, enterprise applications, high traffic databases, and any application that requires 100% sustained CPU usage.* |
| [**High Memory Instance**](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/plans/high-memory/) | Dedicated | **24 GB - 300 GB Memory, 2 - 16 vCPUs, 20 GB - 340 GB Storage**<br>[Starting at $60/mo ($0.09/hour)](https://www.linode.com/pricing/#compute-high-memory)<br><br>Optimized for memory-intensive applications and equipped with Dedicated CPUs, which provide competition free guaranteed CPU resources.<br><br>*Best for in-memory databases, in-memory caching systems, big data processing, and any production application that requires a large amount of memory while keeping costs down.* |
| [**GPU Instance**](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/plans/gpu/) | Dedicated | **1 - 4 NVIDIA Quadro RTX cards, 24 - 96 GB Video Memory, 32 GB - 128 GB Memory, 8 - 24 vCPUs, 640 GB - 2560 GB Storage**<br>[Starting at $1000/mo ($1.50/hour)](https://www.linode.com/pricing/#compute-gpu)<br><br>The only instance type that's equipped with NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPUs (up to 4) for on demand execution of complex processing workloads. <br><br>*Best for applications that require massive amounts of parallel processing power, including machine learning, AI, graphics processing, and big data analysis.* |
