{{< note type="warning" title="Beta Notice" >}}
Akamai's Metadata service is available in beta within select data centers. Add user data when deploying Compute Instances, which can then be consumed by cloud-init, an industry standard system initialization tool. See [Metadata Availability](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/#availability) for a list of supported regions and distributions.
