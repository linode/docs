{{< note type="warning" title="Beta Notice" >}}
Akamai's Metadata service is available in beta within select data centers. Add user data when deploying Compute Instances, which can then be consumed by cloud-init, an industry standard system initialization tool. To learn more about the beta, review our [blog post](https://www.linode.com/blog/compute/metadata-service-now-available-in-open-beta/). For instructions on using the Metadata service and for a list of supported regions and distributions, reference our [documentation](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/). To submit feedback about your experience using the Metadata service, fill out the [Akamai Metadata Service Beta Feedback survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCen-uKVkOEzGc_1WIrX6c-mFvErBGBzGMTdWD2rORjIQErw/viewform).
