## Linode API

Linode’s [API v4](/docs/api) provides the ability to programmatically manage the full range of Linode products and services.

- [Linode Instances Endpoint Collection](/docs/api/linode-instances)

## Linode CLI

The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that allows you to manage your Linode account and resources from the command line. Learn how to use the Linode CLI to [create and manage Linode Instances](/docs/platform/api/linode-cli/#linode-instances).

## Third Party Tools & Integrations

**Terraform**: Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-code tool that includes management features for various types of Linode resources. Use Linode’s [official Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/linode/linode/latest/docs) to [provision Linode Environments](/docs/guides/how-to-build-your-infrastructure-using-terraform-and-linode/). To learn more about Terraform see our documentation library’s [Terraform section](/docs/applications/configuration-management/terraform/).

**Pulumi**: Pulumi is a development tool that allows you to write computer programs which deploy cloud resources. With [Pulumi’s Linode integration](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-linode), you can manage your Linode resources in several programming languages, like JavaScript, Go, Python, and TypeScript. Pulumi manages your resources in the same way as Linode's API or CLI. See [Pulumi’s documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/linode/) to get started.
