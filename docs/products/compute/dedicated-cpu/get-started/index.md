## Deploy a Dedicated CPU Instance

1. Log in to the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) with the username and password you created when signing up.

1. At the top of the page, click **Create** and select **Linode**.

1. Select the [Distribution](/docs/guides/choosing-a-distribution/), [Marketplace App](/docs/products/tools/marketplace/get-started/), or [Image](/docs/products/tools/images/) you would like to use.

    {{< note >}}
Use a [StackScript](https://www.linode.com/stackscripts) to quickly deploy software platforms and system configuration options to your Linux distribution. Some of the most popular StackScripts do things like install a LAMP stack, VPN, or WordPress. You can read more about Stackscripts and how they work in our [Automating Deployments with Stackscripts](/docs/platform/stackscripts/) guide.

1. Choose the region where you would like your Linode to reside. If you’re not sure which to select, see our [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/guides/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the route path between you and a data center in each specific region.

1. Select a Dedicated CPU plan.

1. Give your Linode a label. This is a name to help you easily identify it within the Cloud Manager’s Dashboard. If desired, assign a tag to the Linode in the **Add Tags** field.

1. Create a root password for your Linode in the **Root Password** field. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique.

1. Click **Create**. You are directed back to the Linode's page, and this page reports the status of your Linode as it boots up. You can now use the Cloud Manager to:

    - Boot and shut down your Linode

    - Access monitoring statistics

    - Update your [billing](/docs/guides/manage-billing-in-cloud-manager/) and [account](/docs/guides/accounts-and-passwords/) information

    - Add additional Linode services, like [Block Storage](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/)

    - Open a [support ticket](/docs/guides/support/) and perform other administrative tasks

1. Be sure to bookmark the [Linode Status page](https://status.linode.com/) or [subscribe](/docs/guides/linode-status-page/) to our system status updates by email.
