## Features

### Managed
Using LKE, you can configure, provision, and manage your Kubernetes clusters in a few easy steps.

LKE comes with a complimentary Kubernetes Master per cluster at no additional fee. This includes a complimentary Kubernetes control plane – including API, scheduler, etcd, and resource controllers.

### Automatic Backup and Recovery

A snapshot of your cluster's metadata is backed up continuously, so your cluster is automatically restored in the event of a failure.

All of your master and node components are monitored and will automatically recover if they fail.

### Third Party Integration

Harness the strong open source ecosystem of Kubernetes tooling. LKE supports integration with popular K8s-related tools, such as [Rancher](http://rancher.com), [Helm](http://helm.sh), [Operators](https://coreos.com/operators/), and more.

## Release Notes

See the [LKE changelog](https://developers.linode.com/changelog/linode-kubernetes-engine/) for release notes.

## Pricing

LKE pricing includes only the resources you consume – Linodes, NodeBalancers, and Volumes. Your cluster’s master services are free of charge. [See pricing](https://www.linode.com/pricing/) for Linode resources.
