## Building Blocks

- [Install kubectl](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/install-kubectl): Before you create a cluster with LKE, you need to install kubectl on your local machine.

- [Create an LKE Cluster](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/create-lke-cluster): Quickly and easily create an LKE cluster from the Cloud Manager with a just a few clicks.

- [Download Your kubeconfig](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/download-kubeconfig): Download the kubeconfig file so you can interact with your cluster with kubectl from the command line.

- [Delete an LKE Cluster](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/delete-cluster): You can delete an entire cluster from the Cloud Manager.

- [Add a Node Pool](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/add-node-pool): You can add a Node Pool to your cluster from the Cloud Manager.

- [Edit or Remove Node Pools](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/edit-remove-node-pools): You can easily edit or remove existing Node Pools from the Cloud Manager.

- [Configure Cluster Autoscaling](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/enable-cluster-autoscaling): Enable, edit, or disable the LKE autoscaling feature to automatically scale nodes as the needs of Kubernetes pods change.

- [Reset Kubeconfig](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/reset-kubeconfig): Reset an LKE cluster's kubeconfig from the Cloud Manager.

- [Enable High Availability](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/enable-high-availability): Enable High availability for your LKE cluster, creating additional replicas of your control plane components directly through the Cloud Manager.

## Themes

These guides explore topics such as using Docker, networking, deploying websites, and using LKE with third-party tools.
