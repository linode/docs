## Linode API

Linode’s [API v4](/docs/api) provides the ability to programmatically manage the full range of Linode products and services.

-  [Linode Kubernetes Engine Endpoint Collection](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke)

## Linode CLI

The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that allows you to manage your Linode account and resources from the command line. Learn how to use the Linode CLI to [create and manage LKE clusters](/docs/platform/api/linode-cli/#linode-kubernetes-engine-lke).

## Third Party Tools & Integrations

**Terraform**: Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-code tool that includes management features for various types of Linode resources. Use Linode’s [official Terraform Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/linode/r/volume.html) to [provision Linode Kubernetes Engine Clusters](/docs/guides/how-to-deploy-an-lke-cluster-using-terraform/).
