Shared CPU Compute Instances are virtual machines that offer a significant price-to-performance ratio for a wide range of applications. While most of our other Compute Instance types are equipped with dedicated CPUs, Shared Instances do not. This means that CPU resources are shared with other Compute Instances and a small amount of resource contention is possible.

**Shared plans are ideal for development servers, staging servers, low traffic websites, personal blogs, and production applications that may not be affected by resource contention.**

## Features

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Deliver content to your users faster by placing Shared Instances at regional data centers around the globe.

### Container Clusters

Deploy container clusters to Shared Instances using popular container orchestration tools.

### Price and Performance

No other plan offers more choice. With 10 different configurations, youâ€™re sure to find the right performance at the right price.

## Recommended Workloads

High Memory Compute Instances are suitable for workloads that value much larger amounts of memory than other plans of a similar price. This includes:

- Any production application that requires large amounts of memory
- In-memory database caching systems, such as [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [Memcached](https://memcached.org/)
- In-memory databases, such as possible with [NoSQL](/docs/guides/what-is-nosql/) and [other solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_in-memory_databases)
- [Big data processing](/docs/applications/big-data/) (and data analysis)

## Availability

High Memory instances are available across [all regions](https://www.linode.com/global-infrastructure/).

## Plans and Pricing
