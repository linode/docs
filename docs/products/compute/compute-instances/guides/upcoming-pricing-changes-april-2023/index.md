New pricing for some Compute services has gone into effect starting April 1st 2023. This includes an increase in cost for most Shared and Dedicated CPU Compute Instance plans (excluding the $5/mo 1GB Shared plan), a decrease in cost of network transfer (egress) overage fees, and an increase in cost for additional IPv4 addresses. This page covers each pricing change so you know exactly what to expect on your invoice moving forward.

## Compute Instances

On April 1st 2023, the price for most Shared CPU and Dedicated CPU Compute Instance plans increased by 20%. This excludes the 1 GB Shared CPU (Nanode) plan, which remains at its current $5/mo price. This change also does not affect High Memory and GPU plans. The tables below outline each plan along with the corresponding resources, the original price, and the new price.

## Network Transfer (Egress) Overages

Each Compute Instance plan includes a certain allowance of outbound network transfer per month (ranging from 1 TB to 20 TB). The monthly network allowance of each instance active during a billing period (prorated) is then combined into a monthly transfer pool. Any additional transfer usage that exceeds this monthly pool is billed as a per GB overage charge. To learn more about how network transfer works (and how it is billed), see [Network Transfer Usage and Costs](/docs/products/platform/get-started/guides/network-transfer/).

Starting on April 1st 2023, the network transfer (egress) overage fees was cut in half, from $0.01/GB (previous fee) to $0.005/GB (new fee). The table below details this change.

| Network Transfer Type | Previous Price | <span style="color:#02b159">New Price</span> |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Inbound network transfer (Ingress) | Free (no defined limit) | **<span style="color:#02b159">Free (no defined limit)</span>** |
| Outbound network transfer (Egress) Overage | $0.01/GB | **<span style="color:#02b159">$0.005/GB</span>** |

## Additional IPv4 Addresses

Each Compute Instance includes a free IPv4 address and IPv6 address. Additional IPv4 addresses can be purchased for a fee and added to an instance. Starting on April 1st 2023, the cost for each additional IP address increased from $1/mo to $2/mo.

| IP Address Quantity | Previous Price | <span style="color:#02b159">New Price</span> |
| -- | -- | -- |
| First IPv4 Address | Free | **<span style="color:#02b159">Free</span>** |
| Additional IPv4 Addresses | $1/mo | **<span style="color:#02b159">$2/mo</span>** |
