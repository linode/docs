### Always on Real-Time Intelligent Protection

Always-on DDoS protection monitors, detects, analyzes, and blocks threats to the network in real-time. Attacks are blocked inline, then redistributed across Linode's global fiber backbone.

Rules are automatically created using machine learning from traffic across the global network to intelligently reroute malicious traffic during a DDoS event.

Your serverâ€™s applications are protected from a range of DDOS attack methodologies including UDP, SYN, HTTP floods, and more.

## Pricing

Linode's DDoS Protection is provided for free to all customers.
