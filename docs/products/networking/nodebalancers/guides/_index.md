- [Client IP Address Pass-through](/docs/products/networking/nodebalancers/guides/client-ip/): Learn the methods of retaining client connection details and passing them to backend nodes on a NodeBalancer.

- [Proxy Protocol](/docs/products/networking/nodebalancers/guides/proxy-protocol/): Obtain information about a client when using the TCP protocol.

## High Availability Concepts and Tutorials

- [Introduction to High Availability](/docs/guides/introduction-to-high-availability/): Basic overview of high availability, covering redundancy, monitoring, and failover.

- [Host a Website with High Availability](/docs/guides/host-a-website-with-high-availability/): A walk-through on deploying a high availability web application using Gluster (file replication), Galera (MySQL database replication), and a NodeBalancer.

## Automated Deployment Tutorials
