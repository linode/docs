## Building Blocks

- [Configure a NodeBalancer](/docs/products/networking/nodebalancers/guides/configure/): Create a new NodeBalancer and configure it with a backend Linode.

## Themes

These additional guides explore targeted topics like creating a Linode NodeBalancer using a variety of tools and SSL Configuration.

### NodeBalancer Basics

- [Understanding NodeBalancers](/docs/platform/nodebalancer/what-are-nodebalancers): Linode offers load balancers as a service (LBaaS) called NodeBalancers. NodeBalancers are built for high availability and designed to be maintenance free after initial configuration.

- [Get Started with NodeBalancers](/docs/guides/getting-started-with-nodebalancers/): Get started with Linode NodeBalancers by using a NodeBalancer to begin managing a simple web application.

- [NodeBalancer Reference](/docs/guides/nodebalancer-reference-guide/): A NodeBalancer reference guide with helpful terms and settings.

### Developer Tools

Use these tools to create a Linode NodeBalancer with tools outside of the Cloud Manager.

- [Configure NodeBalancers with the Linode API](/docs/guides/nodebalancers/)

- [Deploy NodeBalancers with the Linode Cloud Controller Manager](/docs/guides/getting-started-with-load-balancing-on-a-lke-cluster/)

- [Create a NodeBalancer with Terraform](/docs/guides/create-a-nodebalancer-with-terraform/)

- [Create and Configure a NodeBalancer with Pulumi](/docs/applications/configuration-management/deploy-in-code-with-pulumi/#create-and-configure-a-nodebalancer)
