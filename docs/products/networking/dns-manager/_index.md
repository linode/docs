## Features

### DDoS

Linode’s DNS service employs Cloudflare to provide denial of service (DDoS) mitigation, load balancing, and increased geographic distribution for our name servers. These factors make our service reliable, fast, and a great choice for your DNS needs.

### High Availability

DNS records are served from Linode name servers all over the world. If one name server suffers an outage it will automatically failover to a redundant server. Because records are cached worldwide, DNS lookups are faster to return.

### Import Zones with Ease

Is your website living on another cloud host's server? The DNS Manager will easily import zones from your current provider as-is. You only have to update your name servers to ours.

### Simple, Convenient Management

Easily import DNS records with AXFR. Migrate domains from another provider using zone transfers.

Simplify and automate the management of zones through the Linode Cloud Manager or the API.

## Pricing

Hosting DNS records with the Linode DNS Manager is free. In order to use the DNS Manager to serve your domains, you must have an active Linode on your account. If you remove all active Linodes, your domains will no longer be served.
