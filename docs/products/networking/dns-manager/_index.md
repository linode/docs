The *Domains* section of the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/domains) is a comprehensive DNS management interface, referred to as the Linode DNS Manager. Within the DNS Manager, you can add your registered domain names and manage DNS records for each of them.

## High Availability

Linode's DNS service is anycasted to over 250 locations (*PoPs*) around the world. This provides distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack mitigation, load balancing, and increased geographic distribution for our [name servers](/docs/guides/dns-overview/#name-servers). If one name server suffers an outage, the service will automatically failover to a redundant name server. These factors make our service reliable, fast, and a great choice for your DNS needs.

## Flexible Configuration

In addition to supporting a wide range of DNS record types, the Linode DNS Manager offers even more flexibility through AXFR transfers and zone types (*primary* and *secondary*). These two features work together so you can create a DNS configuration that works for your own application. Using Linode as the *primary* DNS Manager is the most common option and allows you to manage DNS records directly on the Linode platform. Operating as a *secondary* DNS provider, you can mange your DNS records within other services or tools (like cPanel) but still host them on Linode, taking advantage of the reliability and high availability of our platform.

## Pricing and Availability

The DNS Manager is available at no charge across [all regions](https://www.linode.com/global-infrastructure/).

{{< note >}}
To use the Linode DNS Manager to serve your domains, you must have at least one billable service on your account, such as a Compute Instance, NodeBalancer, or an Object Storage Bucket. If no services exist on your account or if all services are removed, DNS records will no longer be served.
