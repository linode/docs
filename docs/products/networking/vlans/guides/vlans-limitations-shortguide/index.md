## Limitations

- **VLANs are region-specific.**  Once created, a VLAN can only be attached to other Linodes within the same data center.

- **An account can have up to 10 VLANs per region.**

- **A Linode can belong to a maximum of 3 VLANs.** Since there are 3 configurable network interfaces on each Linode, up to 3 VLANs can be attached. If one of those network interfaces is configured for the public internet, there are 2 remaining network interfaces for use with VLANs.

- **VLANs cannot be manually renamed by the user.** If a VLAN's label must be changed, a new VLAN can be created and all required Linodes can be attached to that new VLAN.

- **VLANs cannot be manually deleted by the user.** There is no need to manually delete a VLAN. If a VLAN is no longer needed, simply detach it from all Linodes. After this, it will automatically be deleted within a short timeframe.

- **Network Helper is required for automatic configuration.** If [Network Helper](/docs/guides/network-helper/) has been disabled, the Linode will not *automatically* be able to communicate over the VLAN’s private network. In this case, advanced users can manually adjust their Linode’s internal network configuration files with the appropriate settings for their VLAN. See [Manually configuring a VLAN on a Linode](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/manually-configuring-a-vlan/) for instructions.
