## Basics

- [Use Cases](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/use-cases/): Learn how VLANs can be utilized by exploring some common scenarios.

- [Getting Started with VLANs](/docs/products/networking/vlans/get-started/): An introduction to VLANs, including how to create and administer them within the Cloud Manager.

- [Attach a VLAN to a Compute Instance](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/attach-to-compute-instance/): Learn how to create a VLAN and attach it to a new or existing Compute Instance.

- [Remove a Compute Instance from a VLAN](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/remove-a-compute-instance/)

## Going Further

- [Manually Configuring a VLAN on a Linode](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/manually-configuring-a-vlan/): Manually configure an attached VLAN by adjusting a Linode's internal network configuration files.

- [Creating a Private Network Using Linode API and Linode VLAN](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/manage-vlans-using-linode-api/): This guide shows you how to create a VLAN and attach Linodes to it using the Linode APIv4.

- [Configure Linux as a Router (IP Forwarding)](/docs/guides/linux-router-and-ip-forwarding/): In this tutorial, connect multiple Compute Instances to the same VLAN and learn how to configure one of them as a router. This allows some or all instances in the private network to share the same public IP address.
