## Building Blocks

- [Create a Virtual LAN](/docs/products/networking/vlans/get-started/): Create a Virtual LAN to get started creating a private network.

- [Attach a Linode to Your Virtual LAN](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/attach-a-linode-to-your-vlan/): Attach new or existing Linodes to your Virtual LAN so they have access to a secure and private network.

- [Linode Network Interfaces](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/linode-network-interfaces/): Consult this guide for an overview on private and public networks and the corresponding network interfaces that are created on a Linode.

- **Configure Your Linode**: Once you've attached a Linode to a Virtual LAN, connect to your Linode to enable its private network interface. Use the guide that corresponds to your Linode's distribution.

    - [Configure Your CentOS 8 Linode](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/configure-your-linode-centos-8/)
    - [Configure Your Ubuntu 20.04 Linode](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/configure-your-linode-ubuntu-20-04/)
    - [Configure Your Debian 10 Linode](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/configure-your-linode-debian-10/)

- [Test Your Private Network](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/test-your-private-network/): Your Virtual LAN's private network is up and running. Connect to a Linode within the private network and perform a simple test to verify that it can communicate with other Linodes within the network.

- [Access Your Virtual LAN's Details](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/access-your-vlans-details/): Quickly find your Virtual LAN's networking details.

- [Detach a Linode from Your Virtual LAN](/docs/products/networking/vlans/guides/detach-a-linode-from-your-vlan/): Remove a Linode from your Virtual LAN's private network.
