## Features

### Simple Interface

Control inbound and outbound traffic using the [Linode API](/docs/api/networking), [Linode CLI](/docs/guides/linode-cli/) or [Cloud Manager](https://www.linode.com/products/cloud-manager/).

### Scalable Security in Seconds

Stay protected as your network grows. Effortlessly apply the same ruleset across multiple instances.

### Protect Your Web Apps

Defend your apps and services from malicious attackers by creating rules to only allow traffic from trusted sources. Firewall rules can filter traffic at the network layer, providing fine-grained control over who can access your Linodes.

### Create Custom Firewall Rules

Tailor rulesets for each Linode. Add up to 25 rules per ruleset, and use a customized firewall on a single Linode.

### Making Security More Accessible

Secure your Linode's network traffic without needing to learn or access the command line.
