Linode’s Cloud Firewall service is a robust cloud-based firewall solution available at no additional charge for Linode customers. Through this service, you can create, configure, and add stateful network-based firewalls to Linode Compute Instances and NodeBalancers.

## Enhanced Security

A Cloud Firewall sits between a service (Compute Instance or NodeBalancer) and the Internet and can be configured to filter out unwanted network traffic before it even reaches your server. Defend your apps and services from malicious attackers by creating rules to only allow traffic from trusted sources. Firewall rules can filter traffic at the network layer, providing fine-grained control over who can access your servers.

## Simple Interface

Control inbound and outbound traffic using the [Linode API](/docs/api/networking), [Linode CLI](/docs/products/tools/cli/get-started/) or [Cloud Manager](https://www.linode.com/products/cloud-manager/). Each interface can be integrated into your workflow for seamless control over firewall rules. The Cloud Firewall service makes security more accessible and enables you to secure your network traffic without needing to learn complicated software or access the command line.

## Scalable Security in Seconds

Stay protected as your network grows. Effortlessly apply the same ruleset across multiple Compute Instances and NodeBalancers. This saves time as you no longer need to manually configure internal software on each server.

## Pricing and Availability

Cloud Firewalls are available at no charge across [all regions](https://www.linode.com/global-infrastructure/).

## Limits and Considerations

- Cloud Firewalls are **compatible with Linode Compute Instances and NodeBalancers**. They are not currently directly supported on other Linode services, such as Object Storage.
- A Cloud Firewall can be attached to multiple services (Compute Instances or NodeBalancers), but a service can only be attached to one *active* (enabled) Cloud Firewall at a time.
- A Cloud Firewall’s inbound and outbound rules are applied to Compute Instances, but only inbound rules are applied to NodeBalancers.
- When used in conjunction with NodeBalancers, a Cloud Firewall’s inbound rules only apply to the NodeBalancer's public IP, not the IPs of the backend nodes. This means you may also want to add individual backend nodes to a Cloud Firewall to protect any additional exposed IP addresses.
- Cloud Firewall rules are applied to traffic over the public and private network but are not applied to traffic over a private [VLAN](/docs/products/networking/vlans/).
- A maximum of **25 rules** can be added to each Cloud Firewall (both Inbound and Outbound rules combined).
- A maximum of **255 IP addresses (and ranges)** can be added to each Cloud Firewall rule.
- All **IP addresses** and **IP Ranges** must be formatted correctly, or changes will be unable to be saved.
- A maximum of **15 ports (and port ranges)** can be defined on each Cloud Firewall rule.
