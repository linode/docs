## Linode API

Linodeâ€™s [API v4](/docs/api) provides the ability to programmatically manage the full range of Linode products and services.

- [List Backups](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backups-list)

- [Create Snapshot](/docs/api/linode-instances/#snapshot-create)

- [Cancel Backups](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backups-cancel)

- [Enable Backups](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backups-enable)

- [View Backup](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backup-view)

- [Restore Backup](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backup-restore)

## Linode CLI

The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that allows you to manage your Linode account and resources from the command line.
