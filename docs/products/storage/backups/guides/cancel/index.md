---

You can cancel the Backup Service at any time. From your Linode's details page, choose the **Backups** tab and click the **Cancel Backups** link at the bottom of the page. Cancelling the service removes your saved backups from the Linode platform.

{{< caution >}}
Cancelling your Backup Service irretrievably deletes all of your Linode's Backups, including its manual Snapshot.

To preserve this data, you need to back up your data independently from the Backup Service before cancelling it. You may consult the suggestions in [Backing Up Your Data](/docs/guides/backing-up-your-data/) for more information on how to do this.
