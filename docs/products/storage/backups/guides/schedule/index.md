The Backup service will generate automatic backups according to the schedule that you specify.

1.  From the **Linodes** page, select the Linode.

1.  Click the **Backups** tab.

1.  Under **Settings**, select a time interval from the **Time of Day** dropdown menu. The Backup Service will prioritize *starting* the automated daily backup between these hours.
