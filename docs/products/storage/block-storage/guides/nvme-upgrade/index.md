## What is NVMe-backed Block Storage?

Weâ€™re rolling out an ultra-fast, better-performing, and more reliable NVMe-backed Block Storage service across all 11 of our global data centers. NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) is the hardware interface for next-generation SSDs (solid-state drives). The technology is a significant improvement over traditional spinning hard disk drives, with a 10-20x increase in throughput and up to 2000x improvement in IOPS. With NVMe-backed Block Storage, you can experience a significant performance upgrade for database storage and other tasks where high storage speeds and consistency are critical.

To learn more about Block Storage, visit the [Block Storage Overview](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/) page.

## Upgrading a Volume to NVMe Block Storage

Existing Block Storage Volumes will soon be eligible for a free upgrade to the newer NVMe-only Block Storage solution. If you have a Block Storage Volume attached to a Linode, you will be notified with instructions to initiate the upgrade soon after NVMe Block Storage becomes available in your data center. This page will also be updated to reflect those instructions. Unattached Volumes will automatically be upgraded at a later date.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the performance benefits of NVMe Block Storage?

The table below displays the performance you can expect from NVMe-backed Block Storage. Performance is automatically increased in 60 second bursts for even faster real-world speeds.

| | IOPS | Throughput |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Standard** | 8,000 | 350 MB/s |
| **Burst** | 12,000 | 525 MB/s |

### How much extra will NVMe-backed Block Storage cost?

We were able to provide a tremendous performance boost with NVMe Block Storage at **no additional charge.** Block Storage will remain priced at $0.10/GB per month.

### When will my Volume receive an upgrade to NVMe?

Soon after NVMe-backed Block Storage becomes available in your Volume's data center, you will be notified how to upgrade your existing Volumes. We do not yet have a definitive timeline.
