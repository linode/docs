At any time after the Block Storage Volume has been created, it can be increased to a larger size.

{{< note >}}
At this time, the size of Volumes are only able to be increased (not decreased), which does also increase the cost for the Volume. To decrease the size of your Volume, you will need to create a new Volume at your preferred size, attach it to a Compute Instance, copy over your data, and remove the original Volume.
{{< /note >}}

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes).

1.  If the Volume is attached to a Compute Instance, power off that instance.

1.  Click on the **Volumes** link in the sidebar.

1.  Locate the desired Volume within the list, click the **more options ellipsis** dropdown menu, and select **Resize**.

1.  Enter the new Volume size. The minimum size is the current size of the Volume and maximum is 10,240 GB. Then click **Submit**.

1.  Click **Resize Volume** to start the resize. Once clicked, the **Resizing Instructions** panel appears with the instructions and commands needed to resize the Volume's filesystem. Either save these commands or leave this panel open. The notification bell in the top right of the page will notify you when the resizing is complete.

1.  After the Volume is resized, power back on your Compute Instance.

1.  Once your Compute Instance has fully booted up, you need to run the previously mentioned commands to resize the file system within your Volume.

    1. Login to your Compute Instance using [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/guides/lish/).

    1.  Unmount the Volume, making sure to use the unique path for your own Volume:

            umount /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_BlockStorage1

    1.  Assuming you have an ext2, ext3, or ext4 partition, run a file system check:

            e2fsck -f /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_BlockStorage1

    1.  Then resize it to fill the new Volume size:

            resize2fs /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_BlockStorage1

    1.  Mount your Volume back onto the filesystem:

            mount /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_BlockStorage1 /mnt/BlockStorage1
