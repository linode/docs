## Basics

- [View, Create, and Delete Volumes](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/manage-volumes/): Learn how to view and manage Block Storage Volumes.

- [Attach and Detach Existing Volumes](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/attach-and-detach/): Instructions on attaching and *safely* detaching existing Volumes to (and from) Compute Instances

- [Configure a Volume on a Compute Instance](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/configure-volume/): To use a Volume on a Compute Instance, it needs to first be configured by creating a file system and mounting the device.

- [Resize a Volume](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/resize-volume/): Increase the size of a Block Storage Volume after it has been created.

- [Transfer a Volume to a Different Compute Instance](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/transfer-volume/): Move a Block Storage Volume to a different Compute Instance within the same data center.

- [Transfer Block Storage Data between Data Centers](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/transfer-volume-data-between-data-centers/): Volumes are not able to be migrated between data centers. Instead, you can transfer the data from one Volume into another Volume within a data center.
