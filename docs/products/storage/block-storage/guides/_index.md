## Building Blocks

These guides teach you what you need to know to get started:

### Block Storage Basics

- [Add a Block Storage Volume to a Linode](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/add-volume/): Create a new Block Storage Volume, attach it to your Linode, create a filesystem, and mount your Volume.

- [Attach an Existing Block Storage Volume to a Linode](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/attach-volume/): Attach a Block Storage Volume that was previously created in the Cloud Manager or through the Linode API.

- [Detach a Block Storage Volume from a Linode](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/detach-volume/): Safely detach a Block Storage Volume from a Linode. A Volume should be detached before it is reattached to a different Linode.

- [Delete a Block Storage Volume](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/delete-volume/): Delete a Block Storage Volume when you no longer need any of the data it stores.

### Block Storage Volume Management

- [Resize a Block Storage Volume](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/resize-volume/): Increase the size of a Block Storage Volume after it has been created.

- [Transfer a Volume to a New Linode](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/transfer-volume/): Safely detach your Volume from a Linode and attach it to a different Linode.

- [Transfer Block Storage Data between Data Centers](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/transfer-volume-data-between-data-centers/): Transfer a Block Storage Volumeâ€™s data to a Linode in a different data center.

## Themes

These additional guides in our library explore targeted topics like management, Kubernetes, and using Block Storage with third party applications:

### Use Cases

- [Use Cases for Block Storage](/docs/platform/block-storage/block-storage-use-cases/)

### Managing Block Storage

- [Boot a Linode from a Block Storage Volume](/docs/platform/block-storage/boot-from-block-storage-volume/)

- [Manage Block Storage Volumes with the Linode API](/docs/platform/api/create-block-storage-volumes-with-the-linode-api/)

### Kubernetes

- [Deploy Persistent Volume Claims with the Linode Block Storage CSI Driver](/docs/kubernetes/deploy-volumes-with-the-linode-block-storage-csi-driver/)

### Third-Party Applications

- [Use a Block Storage Volume with Plex Media Server](/docs/applications/media-servers/use-block-storage-with-plex-media-server/)

- [Use a Block Storage Volume with Nextcloud](/docs/applications/cloud-storage/use-block-storage-volume-with-nextcloud/)

- [Install FreeNAS on a Linode with Block Storage](/docs/applications/cloud-storage/freenas-blockstorage/)
