# Shortguide: How to configure and mount a Block Storage volume

Once a Block Storage Volume has been attached to a Linode, you'll need to perform a few steps before you can start using it. These steps include creating a file system (if you're configuring a new Volume) and mounting the Volume to your Linode's system.

To make configuration easier, all the necessary commands can be viewed directly in the Cloud Manager.

1.  Login to the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes) and click on the **Volumes** link in the sidebar.

1.  Locate the desired Volume within the list, click the **more options ellipsis** drop down menu, and select **Show Config**.

1.  The **Volume Configuration** panel will appear containing the commands needed to fully configure the Volume with your Linode.

1.  Login to your Linode using [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/guides/using-the-linode-shell-lish/).

1.  Enter each command that's shown in the **Volume Configuration** panel as needed. The configuration steps are also listed here:

    1.  Create an ext4 file system by running the following command, where `FILE_SYSTEM_PATH` is your Volume's file system path:

            mkfs.ext4 FILE_SYSTEM_PATH

        {{< caution >}}
    If a new filesystem is created on a Block Storage Volume that is already using a filesystem, the above command will result in data loss. You can safely check for the filesystem of an unmounted volume with the following command:

        blkid FILE_SYSTEM_PATH

    If you do not receive output, there is currently no filesystem on this volume.
    {{< /caution >}}

    1.  Create a mount point

            mkdir /mnt/BlockStorage1

    1.  Mount the Volume to that mount point.

            mount FILE_SYSTEM_PATH /mnt/BlockStorage1

    1.  If you want to mount the new Volume automatically every time your Linode boots, add the following line to your **/etc/fstab** file:

            FILE_SYSTEM_PATH /mnt/BlockStorage1 ext4 defaults 0 2

        {{< note >}}
    If you plan on detaching the volume regularly or moving it between other Linodes, you may want to consider adding the flags `noatime` and `nofail` to the **/etc/fstab** entry.

    * `noatime` - This will save space and time by preventing writes made to the filesystem for data being read on the volume.
    *  `nofail`  - If the volume is not attached, this will allow your server to boot/reboot normally without hanging at dependency failures if the volume is not attached.

    Example:

        FILE_SYSTEM_PATH /mnt/BlockStorage1 ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail 0 2
