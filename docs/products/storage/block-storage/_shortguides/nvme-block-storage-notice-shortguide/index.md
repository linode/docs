{{< note >}}
Block Storage is now available in our Atlanta (USA) data center. With this release, Atlanta is home to the first Block Storage deployment built entirely on ultra-fast NVMe SSDs. This new hardware dramatically increases the performance of Block Storage and is offered at no additional cost.

NVMe-based Block Storage infrastructure upgrades will be deployed across our entire fleet. If you have a Block Storage Volume attached to a Linode, you will be notified with instructions to initiate the upgrade once NVMe Block Storage is available in your data center. Unattached Volumes will automatically be upgraded. Review the Availability section in the [Block Storage Overview](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/#availability) page to learn which data centers have already been upgraded.
