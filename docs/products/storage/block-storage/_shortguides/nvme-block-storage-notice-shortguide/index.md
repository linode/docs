Our newer NVMe Block Storage solution is now available in the Atlanta (USA), Frankfurt (Germany), Newark (USA), and Toronto (Canada) data centers. This new hardware dramatically increases the performance of Block Storage and is offered at no additional cost. NVMe-backed Block Storage infrastructure upgrades will soon be deployed across our entire fleet. Review the [NVMe Block Storage Upgrade](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/nvme-upgrade/) guide to learn more about this roll out.
