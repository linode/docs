Object Storage is not enabled for a Linode account by default. All that is required to enable Object Storage is to create a bucket or an Object Storage access key. To cancel Object Storage, see the [Cancel Object Storage](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/cancel/) how-to.

{{< note >}}
Billing for Object Storage starts when it is enabled on the account, **regardless of how it is enabled**. For example, if you enable the service by creating an access key, but you have not yet created a bucket, the $5 monthly flat rate (prorated) for Object Storage is charged for the account. [Cancelling Object Storage](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/cancel/) stops billing for it.
