## Basics

- [Create and Manage Buckets](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/manage-buckets/): Buckets are the primary containers within Object Storage. Learn how to view, create, and delete buckets through the Cloud Manager.

- [Upload and Manage Files (Objects)](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/manage-files/): Learn how to view, upload, download, and delete objects through the Cloud Manager.

- [Manage Access Keys](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/access-keys/): Access keys enable you to access Object Storage through other tools and your own applications. Learn how to generate these in the Cloud Manager.

- [Access Buckets and Files through URLs](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/urls/): Every bucket and file can be accessed by a unique URL. Learn how to obtain these URLs.

- [Configure a Custom Domain (with a TLS/SSL Certificate)](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/custom-domain/): Linode's Object Storage supports accessing buckets and objects through a custom domain. Learn how to configure a custom domain with a TLS/SSL certificate.

- [Cancel Object Storage](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/cancel/): To cancel the Object Storage service you must first delete all your buckets. Then you can cancel the service from the Cloud Manager.

- [Object Storage Use Cases](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/use-cases/): Information on the benefits and common use cases of Linode's Object Storage service.

## Clients and Tools

Guides for using Object Storage with various clients and command-line tools:

- [Linode CLI](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/linode-cli): An easy to use command-line tool for use with Linode's own services.
- [s3cmd](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/s3cmd): One of the most common command-line tools for interacting with S3-compatible object storage solutions, including Linode Object Storage.
- [s4cmd](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/s4cmd): A faster alternative to the s3cmd command-line tool.
