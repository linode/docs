---

The [s4cmd](https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd) software is a command-line tool that can access S3-compatible storage services, such as Linode's Object Storage. It uses the [S3 client](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html) in Amazon's boto3 library. Compared to the popular s3cmd tool, s4cmd is typically much faster but it has less options and is less configurable. For many use cases, the [Linode CLI](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/linode-cli) or [s3cmd](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/s3cmd) is recommended.

## Installing s4cmd

The following commands will install s4cmd on various common operating systems. Additional methods of installing s4cmd can be found within the s4cmd Readme file under [Installation and Setup](https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd#installation-and-setup).

### Mac

To install s4cmd on a Mac, python's package manager (`pip` or `pip3`) can be used.

    pip3 install s4cmd

### Debian and Ubuntu

The APT package manager can be used to install s4cmd on Debian or Ubuntu Linux distributions.

    sudo apt-get install s4cmd

## Configuring Credentials

To access Object Storage buckets and objects, s4cmd needs to know the Access Key and Secret Key to use. By default, s4cmd looks for these credentials in the `~/.s3cfg` file, which is the configuration file that s3cmd uses. If you do not have s3cmd installed and configured, create this file and add the following contents.

{{< file "~/.s3cfg" >}}
[default]
access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
{{< /file >}}

Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with the access key and secret key created on your Linode account. If you haven't yet created these credentials, follow the [Generate an Object Storage Access Key](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/generate-access-keys/) guide.

Additional methods of configuring your credentials can be found on the s4cmd Readme file under [Installation and Setup](https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd#installation-and-setup).

## Specifying the Endpoint URL

Originally, s4cmd was used for Amazon S3. To allow this tool to be used by other S3-compatible solutions, the `--endpoint-url` command option was added. When running any s4cmd command, you will need to specify the full endpoint url of the Linode Object Storage Cluster that your bucket resides in. For a full list of Clusters and their associated S3 endpoints, see the [Object Storage Overview](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/) page. As an example, the following command will list all buckets in the Newark data center:

    s4cmd ls --endpoint-url https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com

## Interacting with Buckets

### List Buckets

**Command:** `s4cmd ls`

**Example**: List all buckets on the account within the Newark data center:

    s4cmd ls --endpoint-url https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com

### Create a Bucket

**Command:** `s4cmd mb s3://[bucket-label]`, replacing *[bucket-label]* with the label you'd like to use for the new bucket.

**Example:** Create a bucket with the label of "example-bucket" in the Newark data center:

    s4cmd mb s3://example-bucket --endpoint-url https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com

### Delete a Bucket

There is currently no defined command for deleting a bucket through s4cmd.

## Interacting with Objects

### List Objects

**Command:** `s4cmd ls [path]`, where *[path]* is the path of the directory you'd like to view within a bucket.

**Example:** List all objects within the bucket called "example-bucket", located in the Newark data center:

    s4cmd ls s3://example-bucket/ --endpoint-url https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com

### Upload an Object

**Command:** `s4cmd put [file] s3://[bucket-label]/[path]`, replacing *[file]* with the name and path of the file you wish to upload, *[bucket-label]* with the label for your bucket and *[path]* with the optional directory within the bucket.

**Example:** Upload the file "file.txt" to the bucket called "example-bucket", located in the Newark data center:

    s4cmd put file.txt s3://example-bucket/ --endpoint-url https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com

### Download an Object or Directory

**Command:** `s4cmd get s3://[bucket-label]/[path]`, replacing *[bucket-label]* with the label for your bucket and *[path]* with the full path and optional filename of the file or directory you wish to download.

**Example:** Download the file "file.txt" from the bucket called "example-bucket", located in the Newark data center:

    s4cmd get s3://example-bucket/file.txt --endpoint-url https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com

### Delete an Object or Directory

**Command:** `s4cmd del s3://[bucket-label]/[path]`, replacing *[bucket-label]* with the label for your bucket and *[path]* with the full path and optional filename of the file or directory you wish to delete.

**Example:** Delete all the files within the "files" directory on the bucket called "example-bucket", located in the Newark data center:

    s4cmd del s3://example-bucket/files/ --endpoint-url https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com

## Additional Commands

Additional commands and options for s4cmd can be found on the [s4cmd Readme](https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd) page or by running `s4cmd --help`.
