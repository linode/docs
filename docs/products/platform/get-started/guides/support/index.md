- [Cloud Estimator](https://www.linode.com/estimator/): Compare both cost per month, as well as save with our predictable and transparent pricing. Explore bundled compute, storage, and transfer packages against AWS, GCP, and Azure.

- [Cloud Pricing Calculator](https://www.linode.com/cloud-pricing-calculator/): Perfect for anyone moving a workload from on-prem to the cloud, switching from one cloud provider to another, or setting up a hybrid or multi-cloud architecture. With this tool, you can receive a full cost breakdown and technical recommendations for your workload.

### Account Access and Login Issues

For issues logging in to your account and other common account-related questions, see [Accounts > FAQs](/docs/products/platform/accounts/faqs/). If you are encountering issues with two-factor authentication and need to recover access to your account, review the [Recovery Procedure](/docs/products/platform/accounts/guides/2fa/#recovery-procedure) on the [Manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on a User Account](/docs/products/platform/accounts/guides/2fa/) guide. For other login-related issues, please use the [Can't sign in to your account?](https://www.linode.com/support/contact/) form.

### Linode Platform

To get help using the Linode Platform or to resolve issues related to Linode products and services, use any of our [self-service resources](#self-service-and-community-based-resources) or [contact support](#contact-customer-support) for assistance.

### Application and Server Configuration Issues

Whenever you need assistance with software that's installed on your Compute Instances, consider reviewing any official documentation and community resources maintained by that software's developers. Alternatively, you can seek out answers through any of the [Self-Service and Community-based Resources](#self-service-and-community-based-resources) we offer. The Customer Support Team does not provide support regarding the installation or configuration of third-party applications.

### Infrastructure Deployment and Configuration.

For guidance on your architecture, migrations, and software deployments, consider working with our Professional Services team. To get started, [contact us](https://www.linode.com/products/pro-services/#speakwithus) or [request a free quote](https://proservices.typeform.com/to/xJiIEy).

If you're looking for a partner to help guide your transition to the Cloud or help build your platform, our [Partner Directory](https://partner-directory.linode.com/s/) offers a list of trusted partners.

### Legal and Compliance Information

Security, privacy, and compliance are important to us. To help you find answers on these pertinent topics, we've created the [Legal & Compliance Center](https://www.linode.com/legal/). Here, you will find all documentation regarding our policies relating to infrastructure use and privacy, available certifications for each data center, and our own security and vulnerability management posture.

### Infrastructure Status Inquiries

For all emergent issues and planned maintenance within our infrastructure, our team will post to (and regularly update) the [Linode status page](https://status.linode.com/) until the issue has been resolved or maintenance completed. If you are experiencing a connectivity issue, or having troubles accessing one of our services, check this page for any system-wide outages. You can also subscribe to receive updates via email/SMS by clicking Subscribe To Updates in the top right corner of the page.

### Report Abuse On Our Platform

Use our [Abuse Portal](https://www.linode.com/legal-abuse/) to report network abuse, unauthorized access attempts, or spam originating from the Linode platform. Please forward spam with the full headers intact, and include logs documenting unauthorized access.

### Large Deployments (Sales)

[Contact our Sales Team](https://www.linode.com/company/contact/) to help you with migration planning, large volume pricing, partner recommendations, and more.

## Self-Service and Community-based Resources

For general questions and issues that are [outside the Scope of Support](#scope-of-support), consider using following resources. These resources may already provide an answer to your question or can help you get an answer and resolve your issues.

- [**Linode Documentation**](/docs/): The Linode Docs Site contains documentation for all of our products as well as a wide variety of other topics, like using Linux, developing a web application, managing databases, and working with configuration management tools. This is a great resource for learning how to use our products and finding tutorials for installing and configuring third-party software on the Linode platform.
    - [Product Docs](/docs/products/): Detailed information and guides for each of our products, features, and services.
    - [Troubleshooting Overview](/docs/guides/troubleshooting-overview/): A quick start guide that provides answers for common server connectivity and management issues.
    - [FAQs for Compute Instances](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/faqs/): A curated list of the most frequently asked questions regarding Compute Instances.

- [**Linode Community Site**](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/): The Community Site enables you to ask questions and get help from other community members. There are thousands of posts that can provide you with in-depth information, but if you can't find what you need, post your own question and let the community help. This is an excellent place to post questions that are [outside the Scope of Support](#scope-of-support).

- **IRC channel**: Join #linode on irc.oftc.net to access our community IRC channel, which provides a space for anyone to discuss the Linode platform.

{{< note type="warning" >}}
When posting questions or sharing details of your issues on self-service or community-based resources, do not include any personal information or account details. You should also never share usernames and passwords or otherwise provide access to your system to someone you do not know.

## Scope of Support

Our Customer Support Team is available to provide support related to the physical operation of the products and services we offer. This includes resolving potential hardware issues within our infrastructure, helping you understand and use our products, helping you understand and pay your bill, ensuring that your network traffic is properly routed, and helping with base system performance issues that may be related to our infrastructure.

Our team does not provide support regarding the installation or configuration of third-party applications, such as mail and web server software, nor do we provide support regarding the Linux configuration on your Compute Instances. For these issues, please consult the various other [resources](#self-service-and-community-based-resources) we have available or contact your system administrator or developer. Additionally, if you are providing a service to your customers, we do not offer technical support for those customers. Here is an excerpt from our [Master Services Agreement](https://www.linode.com/legal-msa/) (v1.4.0):

> Linode does not offer or provide support: (i) for application-specific issues such as application configuration, CGI programming, web server, mail server, database configuration, or any other such issue; (ii) for issues related to the development, maintenance, operation, or other administration of Covered User Data; and/or (iii) to any End User Support.

## Contact Customer Support

Live support from our dedicated Customer Support Team is available 24 hours a day. You can reach us through a support ticket, by phone, or by e-mail.

{{< note type="warning" title="Account Authentication" >}}
When contacting the Customer Support Team through a support ticket, you are automatically authenticated to your user account. If you instead send an inquiry through an email or call the dedicated support line, you will need to authenticate to an account before the support representative is able to disclose any account-specific information.
{{< /note >}}

- **Support ticket:** Support tickets are the primary method for contacting the Customer Support Team. Tickets can be created, viewed, and managed through the Cloud Manager, though you can also use the [Linode CLI](/docs/products/tools/cli/guides/support-tickets/) and [Linode API](/docs/api/support/) if preferred. For help creating a ticket, see the [Create and Manage Support Tickets](#create-and-manage-support-tickets) section below.

- **Phone call:** The dedicated support phone line can provide real-time support to English language speakers. If your inquiry concerns a specific account, please be prepared to authenticate to that account through a support ticket, a one-time passcode (sent to the account's phone number or email address), or alternative means. If your call is diverted to voicemail, please leave a detailed message explaining your problem. Your call will be returned as quickly as possible.
    - +1 (609) 380-7100
    - +1 (855) 454-6633 (North America toll-free)

- **E-mail:** Whenever possible, it is recommended to create a support ticket. However, general questions that are *not account-specific* can be sent to *support@linode.com*. If your inquiry is account-specific and you are not able to log in to the Cloud Manager, fill out the [can't log in form](https://www.linode.com/support/contact/).

To help us give you the best possible answer when contacting the Support Team, consider the following advice.

- **Be specific and detailed.** We need to know what is happening. Providing error logs and outputs from commands will go a long way to getting you a faster and more accurate answer.
- **Be clear.** Giving us context and sharing any troubleshooting steps you have already taken or resources you have looked at will help clarify what is going on and what additional steps we need to take on our end.

## Create and Manage Support Tickets

All Tickets can be created, viewed, and managed on the [Support Tickets](https://cloud.linode.com/support/tickets) page in the Cloud Manager.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) and select **Help & Support** from the sidebar menu.

This screen lists all open tickets by default. For a list of past tickets, navigate to the **Closed Tickets** tab. Click on a specific ticket to open that ticket, view the history, and to reply.

To open a new support ticket, click the **Open New Ticket** button. Enter a summary of the issue into the **Title** field. Then, select the product or service that is affected by the issue. In the **Description** field, enter in a clear description of the issue you are experiencing.

When creating a ticket or replying to a ticket, keep in mind that you can attach files and use Markdown formatting.

- **File attachmets:** Up to 5 files can be attached to each ticket. Accepted file types and extensions include:
    - Images: `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.pjpg`, `.pjpeg`, `.tif`, `.tiff`
    - Documents: `.pdf` or `.txt`

- **Markdown Formatting.** Proper formatting and structure can make your questions or issues easier to identify and understand. Use inline code to wrap commands, code blocks for output (or logs), and headings to create separate sections. You can also bold or italicize text, format items or steps as lists, and add block quotes. For help with Markdown formatting, use this [cheat sheet](http://demo.showdownjs.com/).
