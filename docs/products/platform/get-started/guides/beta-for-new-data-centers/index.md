Akamai is expanding its services to new data centers across the globe. Each new data center will undergo a beta period, where a limited number of interested customers can deploy services in these regions. All Akamai cloud computing services are fully operational in these data centers. In addition, Premium plans and upgraded Object Storage clusters are only available in these new data centers. As a beta participant, please review this guide for additional specifications and details you may need when configuring your workloads in the one of these data centers.

{{< note type="warning" >}}
Capacity in beta data centers may be limited as we continue to scale up resources. Additionally, the beta environment is subject to change. We strongly suggest that participants do not run production workloads during the beta.

## Deploy Services in a Beta Data Center

Follow the instructions below to target one of the new data centers when deploying a service.

-   **Cloud Manager:** Select the name of the data center you wish to use in the region dropdown menu.

    ![Screenshot of the Cloud Manager region selection dropdown menu](select-washington-dc-cloud-manager.png)

-   **Linode CLI and Linode API:** If a command or request requires a region ID, use the one that corresponds to your desired data center in the [table above](#list-of-new-data-centers).

{{< note type="warning" noTitle=true >}}
You must enrolled in the beta to select one of the beta data centers when deploying services. If you are a beta participant but are not able to target one of these data centers, please contact the [Support team](https://www.linode.com/support/) for assistance. You need to request access to *each* data center you wish to use during the beta period.

## Pricing

{{< note >}}
Starting July 1st 2023, services deployed in Chicago, Paris, and Washington, DC will no longer be free for beta participants. Charges will start to accrue for any new or existing services on your account. If you do not wish to be charged for a particular service, be sure to delete it prior to this date.
{{< /note >}}

Services utilized as part of the beta are free to users. Once the beta period ends for a particular data center, you will start accruing charges for any services that are still deployed to that region. You will receive an email notifying you of the billing start date as we transition each data center to general availability.

## Product Availability

Each data center in this beta is slated to have all of Akamai’s cloud computing services available during the beta period. In addition, we are launching a new Premium Plan tier and have made improvements to our Object Storage service.

### Object Storage

The new data centers feature enhanced Object Storage, which improves upon the consistency and reliability of the existing service and offers increased capacity (outlined below). Review the [Availability](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/#availability) and [Specifications](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/#specifications) section of the Object Storage documentation for more details.

- **Max storage** (*per region, per account*): 1 PB (up from 5 TB)
- **Max # of objects** (*per region, per account*): 1 billion (up from 50 million)

The following table includes the IDs and URLs of each new Object Storage cluster:

| Data Center | Cluster ID | Cluster URL |
| --| -- | -- |
| Chennai, India | `in-maa-1` | `https://in-maa-1.linodeobjects.com` |
| Chicago, IL, USA | `us-ord-1` | `https://us-ord-1.linodeobjects.com` |
| Paris, France | `fr-par-1` | `https://fr-par-1.linodeobjects.com` |
| Stockholm, Sweden | `se-sto-1` | `https://se-sto-1.linodeobjects.com	` |
| Washington, DC, USA | `us-iad-1` | `https://us-iad-1.linodeobjects.com` |

### Premium Plans

A new [Premium tier](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/plans/premium/) Dedicated CPU plan type for Compute Instances is available only in the new data centers. This is in addition to our standard tier Dedicated CPU, Shared CPU, and High Memory instance types. These Premium tier instances guarantee a baseline hardware class that includes new AMD EPYC™ CPUs. These Premium offerings are built for applications with critical performance needs such as enterprise video encoding, AI, CI/CD, build servers, and data analysis. The table below outlines the pricing and hardware specifications for Premium tier Dedicated CPU Instances:

| <div class="w-40">Plan</div> | <div class="w-36">Price</div> | RAM (GB) | CPU Cores | Storage (GB) | Transfer (TB) | Network In/Out (Gbps)
| --- |  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Premium 4 GB   | $43/mo ($0.06/hr)    | 4   | 2  | 80    | 4  | 40/4  |

## Additional Specifications

### IP Sharing and Failover

All new data centers support IP sharing and BGP-based failover, which can be configured on IPv4 addresses (public and private) and addresses from IPv6 routed ranges (/64 and /56). To configure failover, you can use [lelastic](https://github.com/linode/lelastic), Linode's own software, or software like FRR, BIRD, or GoBGP. For more information on failover, consult our [failover documentation](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/failover/).

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chennai, India | Supported | BGP-based (new) | [lelastic](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/failover/#configure-failover) / [FRR](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/failover-bgp-frr/) | 25 |

| Washington, DC, USA | Supported | BGP-based (new) | [lelastic](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/failover/#configure-failover) / [FRR](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/failover-bgp-frr/) | 17 |

### Lish Gateways

Lish and Glish provide direct access to your Compute Instances, bypassing the need for SSH or a VNC. For more information on Lish, consult our guide on how to [Access Your System Console Using Lish](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
