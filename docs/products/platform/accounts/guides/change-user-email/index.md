Linode uses the contact information on file in your account to notify and bill you. Keep this information current to prevent service interruptions. It's especially important to keep your email address current.

The **Billing Info** and **User & Grants** pages have email address fields. The email addresses saved on these pages receive different notifications, as described in the following sections. If you are the only user, you should enter your email address on both pages. If there are multiple users, verify that the primary account holder's email address is current on the **Billing Info** page.

## Modify Billing Contact Email

See [Update Billing Contact Information](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/update-billing-contact-info/)

## Modify User Account Email

Use the **Users & Grants** page to modify the email address associated with a user account. The email addresses listed on this page receive IP whitelist warnings, password reset messages, and support tickets for services that their associated users have permission to access. Users with limited account access can also receive invoices and receipts if granted access to that information.

Only full account access users can receive threshold notification emails.

1. Click the **Account** link in the sidebar.
1. Click the **Users & Grants** tab.
1. Click the **User Profile** link for the desired user.
