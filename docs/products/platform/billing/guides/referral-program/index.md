When you refer a new user to Linode through our referral program, both you and the new user can receive a promotional credit. Here are the program details:

-  **A new user receives a $100 60-day credit** when they sign up through a referral link. Before the credit is applied, they must add a valid payment method to their account.

-  **The referrer receives a $25 non-expiring credit** once the new user has been active for 90-days and spends $25 or more on services (after their promotional credit has been used or has expired).

To learn more about this program, visit the [Referral Program](https://www.linode.com/referral-program/) page on our website.

### Find Your Referral Link

To activate the referral program and obtain a referral link, you must spend at least $25 with Linode, not including any promotional credits added to your account. Once activated, your referral link (including your unique referral code) can be viewed within the Cloud Manager.

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select the **My Profile** link by clicking on your username at the top of the page.
1.  Select the **Referrals** tab.
1.  The referral code and URL are listed within this section.

You can provide the referral link to friends and colleagues as well as post it to your website and social media.
