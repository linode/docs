All of your billing history, including previous invoices and payments, is accessible within the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/account/billing) on the **Billing & Payment History** section within the **Billing Info** page (see [Accessing Billing Information](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/access-billing/)). By default, all transactions (both invoices and payments) from the last *6 months* are displayed. To customize this, use the dropdown menus on the top right of this section.
