## Preventing Tax Collection

For most customers, including those using Linode for most business and personal reasons, it's preferable to have Linode automatically calculate any required taxes and add them to each invoice. That said, some registered businesses or organizations may wish to prevent taxes from being added to their Linode invoices. This includes business that are tax exempt or businesses that are liable to pay taxes directly to their government's tax agency due to a special tax status or program (like RCM - Reverse Charge Mechanism).

In most cases, tax collection can be prevented by [adding a tax ID](#adding-a-tax-id) to your Linode account. Users within the **United States** and **Canada** will need to submit both their tax ID and a state tax exemption or reseller's certificate in a [Support Ticket](https://www.linode.com/support/) before becoming exempt. Registered Canadian businesses may become exempt from *PST* sales tax but will always be billed for GST, HST, and QST sales tax.

{{< note type="alert" >}}
If you are located in one of the countries that require taxes on our services, you are still liable for those taxes. Adding your tax ID does not exempt you from your liability to pay any taxes that have been mandated by your country for our services. Instead, this allows you to settle your taxes directly with your government's tax agency.
{{< /note >}}

### Adding a Tax ID

To add (or update) your account with a tax ID, follow the instructions below. A tax ID can also be added to an account during the signup process.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

1. Navigate to the **Account** link in the sidebar.

1. Expand the **Update Contact Information** panel under the **Billing Info** tab.

1. Enter your tax ID in the **Tax ID** field.

1. Click on the **Save** button at the bottom of the **Update Contact Information** panel.

## FAQs

### How is my tax location determined?

Your tax location is determined by the contact information you provided during sign up or under the **Account** page in the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

### How can I change my tax location?

You may update your tax location by navigating to the **Account** page in the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) and then expanding the **Update Contact Information** panel.

### My business is tax exempt. How can I stop further taxes from being charged to my Linode account?

If your business or organization is tax exempt, you should add a verifiable tax ID to your Linode account. Once verified, taxes will no longer be added to invoices for customers outside of the **United States** and **Canada**. See [Preventing Tax Collection](#preventing-tax-collection). Customers inside the **United States** and **Canada** will additionally need to submit any tax exemption certificates or reseller's certificates by [Opening a Support Ticket](https://www.linode.com/support/) which contains the required information. Registered businesses in **Canada** will always be billed for GST and HST sales tax. Registered Canadian businesses may become exempt from PST sales tax by submitting a valid tax ID and PST certificate.

### How can I review the taxes charged on previous invoices?

To view previous invoices, see the [Viewing Invoices and Payments](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/view-history/) guide. When viewing the invocie, review the **Tax** column to see the taxes that were charged on each service.

### Why is my invoice in USD? Can I get an invoice in another currency?

To keep our pricing stable and consistent, rather than fluctuating with exchange rates, we do not bill in local currency. All invoices are in USD.
