## Linode API

Linodeâ€™s [API v4](/docs/api) provides the ability to programmatically manage the full range of Linode products and services.

- [Enable Linode Managed](/docs/api/account/#linode-managed-enable)

- [Managed Endpoint Collection](/docs/api/managed)

## Linode CLI

The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the Linode API v4 that allows you to manage your Linode account and resources from the command line.
