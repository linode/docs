<!--
Use this archetype to add biographical information to a contributor's profile page in the /docs/contributors/ directory. For example:

    hugo new -k authorpage contributors/firstname-lastname/_index.md

Guides are associated to a contributor's profile page by setting the `contributors` and potentally `authors` parameters in a guide's frontmatter. If a contributor's name is `FirstName LastName`, then the markdown file for their contributor page should be located at `docs/contributors/firstname-lastname/_index.md`. To be attributed as an author for a particular guide, the contributor's name should be listed in both the `authors` and `contributors` arrays for that guide. To be attributed as a general contributor for that guide, the contributor's name should only be listed in `contributors'.

authors: ["FirstName LastName"]
contributors: ["FirstName LastName"]

The link frontmatter should be a link to the contributor's website (or GitHub profile or something else if they prefer). The link and email frontmatter are optional.
-->

The description in the frontmatter is rendered as a meta description element on the contributor profile page.

A short biography of the docs author/contributor. This biography text is displayed above a listing of their published docs/content.
