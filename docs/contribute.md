Get published by Linode, and get paid! Earn \$100 per article, if it's accepted for publication.

We're expanding the Linode Guides & Tutorials, and we want you to help! If you like writing, teaching people how to use Linux, and money, we want to hear from you. The guidelines are below.

Topic List
----------

Submit your own topic, or choose from the list of open topics we want to add to the Linode Library:

-   Nginx Tuning and Performance
-   [OpenChange](http://www.openchange.org/)
-   [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/)
-   [daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) - Make sure you write about the tool at the link, as there are several products with similar names

Each article is worth \$100 if it is accepted for publication. In addition, we always welcome edits, suggestions, and updates to existing guides.

Completed Topics
----------------

These authors got their articles published and \$100. You could be next.

How Much Money Will I Earn?
---------------------------

We will pay you \$100 per article that is accepted for publication, in cash via PayPal, or as Linode credit. Note that submitting an article is not a guarantee of publication. After you submit it, we will let you know if your article has been accepted.

Write Your Article
------------------

Use the [style guide](/docs/style-guide). While you're writing, make sure your content is:

-   Accurate. Your instructions should be straightforward and technically accurate.
-   Formatted. Your style should use [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) formatting and match the Linode Library [style guide](/docs/style-guide.md).
-   Original. Your content should be original material written for Linode. We will not accept submissions that have been copied from other sources.

Want to make sure you don't waste time writing a long article we can't use? Submit a writing sample first, to **librarysubmissions @ linode.com**.

Submit Your Article
-------------------

Submit your article as a [pull request on GitHub](http://www.github.com/linode/docs), or by emailing it to <librarysubmissions@linode.com> as a plain text or Markdown file attachment. Writing samples are welcome as well.

Got images? Attach them as **.png** or **.jpg** files. If an image is over 650 pixels wide, please send both the original and a 650-pixel-wide version.

Submission checklist:

-   Article in **.txt** or **.md** format
-   Images
-   Your name, as you want it to appear in the Library
-   PayPal account information, or Linode account information for Linode credit

Once you've submitted your article, here's what you can expect:

1.  You'll receive a brief response acknowledging your submission.
2.  We will do a technical review of your material. This will take a few days.
3.  We will do a copy review of the article. This will take a few days.
4.  You may receive questions or comments from us, or a request for a resubmission with a few changes.
5.  We will let you know that your article has been chosen for publication and send you the final version we are planning to publish. You will have 36 hours to respond and approve our publication of the final version.
6.  If you respond positively (non-response will be taken as a go-ahead to publish), we will publish the article and give you the cash or Linode credit.
