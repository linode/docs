Ruby on Rails is a popular rapid development web framework that allows web designers and developers to implement fully featured dynamic web applications using the Ruby programming language. This guide describes the required process for deploying Ruby on Rails with Passenger and the nginx web server on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic).

Install Required Packages
-------------------------

First, make sure you have the `universe` repositories enabled on your system. Your `/etc/apt/sources.list` should resemble the following (you may have to uncomment or add the `universe` lines):

{: .file }
/etc/apt/sources.list
:   ~~~
    ## main & restricted repositories
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic main restricted
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic main restricted

    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu karmic-security main restricted
    deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu karmic-security main restricted

    ## universe repositories
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic universe
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic universe
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic-updates universe
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic-updates universe

    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu karmic-security universe
    deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu karmic-security universe
    ~~~

If you added `universe` to the items in your list, you'll need to update your repository database:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade

Issue the following command to install packages required for Ruby on Rails.

    apt-get install wget build-essential ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev irb1.8 rdoc1.8 zlib1g-dev libopenssl-ruby1.8 rubygems1.8 libopenssl-ruby libzlib-ruby libssl-dev libpcre3-dev

Create symbolic links to the installed version of Ruby:

    ln -s /usr/bin/ruby1.8 /usr/bin/ruby
    ln -s /usr/bin/irb1.8 /usr/bin/irb

Install the `rake` and `rack` gems:

    gem install rake rack

Finally, install the version of Ruby On Rails that your application requires. Issue one the following commands for the version you need:

    gem install rails --version 2.1.2
    gem install rails --version 2.2.2
    gem install rails --version 2.3.5
    gem install rails --version 3.0.4

If you are unsure of the version you require, you can install the latest version with the following command:

    gem install rails

Additionally, the application you deploy will likely have additional dependencies. Install these dependencies before proceeding.

Install Passenger and Nginx
---------------------------

Proceed to the [Phusion Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/install.html) site and locate the link for the current source code tarball. Download it as follows (substitute the link for the current version). You may need to install `wget` first by issuing the command `apt-get install wget`.

    cd /opt
    wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/59007/passenger-2.2.4.tar.gz
    tar xzvf passenger-2.2.4.tar.gz

Run the Phusion Passenger installer for nginx:

    cd passenger-2.2.5/bin
    ./passenger-install-nginx-module

You'll be greeted by the Phusion Passenger nginx installer program. Press "Enter" to continue with the installation.

When prompted for the nginx installation method, we recommend you choose "1" to allow the installer to automatically download, compile, and install nginx for you. Unless you have specific needs that would necessitate passing custom options to nginx at compile time, this is the safest way to proceed. Accept the default installation location for nginx.

Please do **not** remove the Passenger files from `opt` after the installation. They need to stay in place or your installation will not function correctly.

Set up an Init Script for Nginx
-------------------------------

Nginx is now installed in `/opt/nginx`, but there are no "init" scripts to control this process. Issue the following sequence of commands to download a script, move it to the proper directory, set the proper permissions and set system startup links:

    cd /opt
    wget -O init-deb.sh http://www.linode.com/docs/assets/565-init-deb.sh
    mv /opt/init-deb.sh /etc/init.d/nginx
    chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
    /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f nginx defaults

You can now start, stop, and restart Nginx just like any other server daemon. For example, to start the server, issue the following command:

    /etc/init.d/nginx start

The configuration file for Nginx is located at `/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`. This is the file you'll need to edit to add support for your Rails applications. A default server is already configured in this file, and it also contains examples for alternate virtual host and SSL configurations.

Install MySQL Support (optional)
--------------------------------

If your application uses MySQL, install the database server by following our [MySQL on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) guide](/docs/databases/mysql/ubuntu-9-10-karmic). Once it's installed and configured properly, issue the following commands:

    apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev libmysql-ruby
    gem install mysql --no-rdoc --no-ri -- --with-mysql-dir=/usr/bin --with-mysql-lib=/usr/lib/mysql --with-mysql-include=/usr/include/mysql
