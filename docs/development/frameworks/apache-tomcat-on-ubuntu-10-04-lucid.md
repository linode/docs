Apache Tomcat is an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and Java Server Pages technologies. You may choose to run application within Tomcat using either the OpenJDK implementation or the Sun Microsystems implementation of the Java development environment.

Before following this guide, ensure that your system is up to date and that you have completed the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/). If you are new to Linux server administration, we recommend reviewing our [beginner's guide](/docs/beginners-guide/) and the article concerning [systems administration basics](/docs/using-linux/administration-basics).

Set the Hostname
----------------

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Choose and Install Java Implementation
--------------------------------------

Make sure your package repositories and installed programs are up to date by issuing the following commands:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded

You must choose which implementation of the Java language you wish to use. Note that there is some variance in the implementations of the Java language, and you should install a version that is compatible with the application that you are hoping to run and/or write.

If you choose to run OpenJDK, you can skip the rest of this section, as OpenJDK will be installed as a dependency when you install the `tomcat6` package; OpenJDK is pulled in by the `default-java` meta package in Ubuntu.

If you would like to run the Sun Microsystems implementation of Java, edit the `/etc/apt/sources.list` so that it resembles the following example. This will enable access to the "partner" repository:

{: .file }
/etc/apt/sources.list
:   ~~~
    ## main & restricted repositories
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted

    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-updates main restricted
    deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-updates main restricted

    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-security main restricted
    deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-security main restricted

    ## universe repositories - uncomment to enable
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid universe
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid universe

    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-updates universe
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-updates universe

    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-security universe
    deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-security universe

    ## partner repositories
    deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner
    deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner

    deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid-updates partner
    deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid-updates partner

    deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid-security partner
    deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid-security partner
    ~~~

Issue the following command to update your system's package repositories:

    apt-get update

Now you are ready to install Sun Java with the following command (after agreeing to the license terms):

    apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

Install Apache Tomcat
---------------------

To install Tomcat, issue the following command:

    apt-get install tomcat6

You may also want to install the `tomcat6-docs`, `tomcat6-examples`, and `tomcat6-admin` tools which provide web-based applications that document, test, and allow you to administer Tomcat. You can install all three with the following command:

    apt-get install tomcat6-docs tomcat6-examples tomcat6-admin

Tomcat should now be totally functional, following installation and your next system reboot. If you need to start, stop, or restart Tomcat you can use the following commands:

    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start
    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop
    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart

Test and Use Tomcat
-------------------

You can test your Tomcat installation by pointing your browser at `http://[yourdomain-or-ip-address]:8080/`. By default, files are located in the `/usr/share/tomcat6` directory. To configure the admin area, you'll need to add the following lines to the end of your `tomcat-users.xml` file, substituting your own username and password. Make sure you keep the "manager" role.

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml
:   ~~~ xml
    <role rolename="manager"/>
    <user username="username" password="examplemorris" roles="manager"/>
    ~~~

Issue the following command to restart the Tomcat server, which will allow this change to take effect:

    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart

Congratulations! You know have a working Apache Tomcat installation.
