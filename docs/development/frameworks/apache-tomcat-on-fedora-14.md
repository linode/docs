Apache Tomcat is a free and open source software implementation for Java Servlets. It provides support for the Java Server Pages (JSP) that power many popular web-based applications.

This guide assumes that you have a working installation of Fedora 14, and that you have followed our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/) to get your system working and up to date. If you are new to Linux server administration, you may be interested in our [introduction to Linux concepts guide](/docs/tools-reference/introduction-to-linux-concepts/), [beginner's guide](/docs/beginners-guide/) and [administration basics guide](/docs/using-linux/administration-basics).

Set the Hostname
----------------

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Install Apache Tomcat
---------------------

Issue the following command to install the latest version of Tomcat 6, along with the OpenJDK runtime environment and developer tools:

    yum update
    yum install tomcat6 tomcat6-webapps tomcat6-admin-webapps java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel.i686
    chkconfig tomcat6 on

Issue the following command to ensure that the file permissions of crucial folders are set properly:

    chmod -R g+w /var/log/tomcat6 /etc/tomcat6/Catalina /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/ /var/log/tomcat6/ /var/cache/tomcat6/temp /var/cache/tomcat6/work

Start the tomcat6 service with the following command:

    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start

Tomcat should now be totally functional. In the future, if you need to start, stop, or restart, you can use the following commands:

    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start
    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop
    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart

Test and use Tomcat
-------------------

You can test your Tomcat installation by pointing your browser to `http://[yourdomain-or-ip-address]:8080/`. By default, files are located at `/usr/share/tomcat6/webapps/`.

At this point, you may want to create a user to access the "Tomcat Manager" web application. This will give you some information concerning your Tomcat instance, as well as some demo applications for testing. To add a user, edit the `/etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml` file to include the following line, substituting your own username and password. Make sure you keep the "manager" role.

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml
:   ~~~ xml
    <user name="username" password="examplemorris" roles="manager" />
    ~~~

Once you have saved the `tomcat-users.xml` file, restart the tomcat6 service with the following command:

    /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart

At this point, you will be able to log in to the Tomcat Manager application and begin deploying Java Servlets with Apache Tomcat!
