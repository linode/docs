Apache Tomcat is an open-source software implementation of the Java Servlet and Java Server Pages technologies. With this guide, you'll run applications within Tomcat using the OpenJDK implementation of the Java development environment.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for [setting your Linode's hostname](/docs/getting-started/#set-the-hostname) and [timezone](/docs/getting-started/#set-the-timezone).

1.  Follow our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide to [create a standard user account](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#add-a-limited-user-account), [harden SSH access](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#harden-ssh-access), [remove unnecessary network services](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#remove-unused-network-facing-services) and [create firewall rules](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#configure-a-firewall) for your web server; you may need to make additional firewall exceptions for your specific application.

    {{< content "limited-user-note-shortguide" >}}

1.  Install the Java Development Kit.

        sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless

1.  Run the following commands to check the version of java that is installed.

        java -version
        javac -version

1.  Install the `wget` and `tar` utilities. You will need these in a later section to install the Apache Tomcat 9.

        sudo yum install wget -y && sudo yum install tar

## Download and Install Apache Tomcat

1.  Create a directory to download Apache Tomcat 9:

        sudo mkdir /usr/local/tomcat

1.  Change to `/usr/local/tomcat` and download Apache Tomcat 9. As of writing this guide, Tomcat 9.0.33 is the latest version. See [Apache Tomcat's download page](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) for their latest core tarball:

        sudo wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.33/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.33.tar.gz

      {{< caution >}}
Ensure that the version number matches the Tomcat 9 version you wish to download.
{{< /caution >}}

1.  Extract the downloaded tarball's contents into `/usr/local/tomcat` directory:

        sudo tar xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.33.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/tomcat

1.  Create a symbolic link to the latest version of Tomcat, that points to the Tomcat installation directory:

        sudo ln -s /usr/local/tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.33 /usr/local/tomcat/tomcat

1.  Create a `tomcat` user and change the directory ownership to `tomcat`:

        sudo useradd -r tomcat
        sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat

1.  Create a new `systemd` service file, `/etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service`, in the text editor of your choice with the following details:

      {{< file "/etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service" service >}}
[Unit]
Description=Tomcat Server
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=tomcat
Group=tomcat

Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre
Environment='JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true'
Environment=CATALINA_HOME=/usr/local/tomcat
Environment=CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/tomcat
Environment=CATALINA_PID=/usr/local/tomcat/temp/tomcat.pid
Environment='CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M'
ExecStart=/usr/local/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh start
ExecStop=/usr/local/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh stop

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
{{< /file >}}

1.  Reload the `systemd` daemon to let it know about the `tomcat.service` that you created:

        sudo systemctl daemon-reload

1.  Start and enable the Tomcat server:

        sudo systemctl enable tomcat
        sudo systemctl start tomcat

1.  Configure your firewall to access the Tomcat server on port 8080:

        sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
        sudo firewall-cmd --reload

## Test and Use Tomcat

You can test your Tomcat installation by pointing your browser at your domain name specifying port `8080`. For example, you might use `http://example.com:8080/`, replacing `example.com` with your domain name. Note that Tomcat listens on network port 8080 and does not accept forced HTTPS connections by default. By default, Tomcat configuration files are located in the `/usr/local/tomcat/conf` directory.

### Configure tomcat9-admin (optional)

1.  To use the `tomcat9-admin` web application, add the following lines to the end of your `/usr/local/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml` file before the `</tomcat-users>` line, substituting your own username and secure password. If using Tomcat Admin, include both the "manager-gui" role for the manager and the "admin-gui" role for the host-manager application.

    {{< file "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml" xml >}}
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<user username="username" password="password" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>

{{< /file >}}

    {{< note >}}
If you are not using the web application and plan to manage your application(s) from the command line only, you should not enter these lines, because doing so may expose your server to unauthorized login attempts.
{{</ note >}}

1.  For Tomcat versions 8+ the managers have been pre-configured to only allow access from the same IP of the server where it's installed. If you're trying to access it from a browser remotely, you'll need to comment out this configuration in the file `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml`.

    {{< file "/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml" xml >}}
...
<!--
  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />
-->
...
{{</ file >}}

1.  Restart the Tomcat server, which will allow these changes to take effect:

        sudo systemctl restart tomcat
