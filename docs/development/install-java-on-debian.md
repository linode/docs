Java is a powerful programming language. Software written in Java can be compiled and run on any system. Unlike Python or C, Java does not come pre-installed on Linode distribution images. This guide installs the OpenJDK 7 runtime environment and development kit in Debian 8. OpenJDK is the free and open-source implementation of the Java SE Development Kit.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible.

3.  Update your system:

        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade


## Install Java Runtime Environment (Java JRE)

If you don't plan on using Java to write programs, the JRE is all you need. In Debian the JRE metapackage is called `default-jre`, this metapackage pulls several packages needed to run headless Java applications.

	sudo apt install default-jre

After the installation finishes, you can verify that the JRE was installed by running `dpkg -s default-jre`. The output will contain information about the Java installation, including a status line confirming that Java is installed:

        Package: default-jre
        Status: install ok installed

## Install Java Development Kit (Java JDK)

If you plan on using Java to write or edit programs on your Linode, install the JDK.

	sudo apt install default-jdk

After the installation finishes, verify that the JDK was installed with `dpkg -s default-jdk`. The command outputs a status line confirming that Java is installed:

	Package: default-jdk
	Status: install ok installed

You can also check by running `javac`, the Java compiler. If you need to compile a java application on your Linode, run `javac foobar.java`. `Javac` will compile the program, given no compilation errors. You can run the program using `java foobar`.
