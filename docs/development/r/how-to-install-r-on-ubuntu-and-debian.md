## What is R?

[R is a programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) used for statistical analysis in addition to data visualization. The language is highly extensible through the [Comprehensive R Archive Network(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/), which hosts more than 10,000 R packages for producing publication quality figures, specialized computational tools, and more.

Although R can be installed through the default Debian or Ubuntu repository, the method outlined in this guide will ensure that you install the most up-to-date stable release.

## Install R on Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 9

1.  Open `/etc/apt/sources.list` and add the following line to the end of the file:

    Ubuntu:

        deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/

    Debian:

        deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/debian stretch-cran34/

2.  Add the key ID for the CRAN network:

    [Ubuntu GPG key](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu/):

        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E084DAB9

    [Debian GPG key](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/debian/):

        sudo apt install dirmngr
        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 'E19F5F87128899B192B1A2C2AD5F960A256A04AF'

3.  Update the repository:

        sudo apt update

4.  Install the R binaries:

        sudo apt install r-base

## Download Packages from CRAN

1.  Open the R interpreter:

        R

2.  The interpreter will open with some information about the version. Enter `install.packages("ggplot2")`:

4.  When quitting the interpreter, you will be prompted to save the workspace image. If you choose yes, this will save all the user defined objects for the next session:

## RStudio IDE Desktop

The R interpreter lacks features such as a debugger which may be needed for larger projects. RStudio is an IDE that comes with many tools for development right out of the box.

1.  Download RStudio as a Debian package:

        wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-xenial-1.1.414-amd64.deb

2.  Install the package:

        sudo dpkg -i rstudio-xenial-1.1.414-amd64.deb

If there are missing dependencies, those can be installed with the following command:

    sudo apt install -f
