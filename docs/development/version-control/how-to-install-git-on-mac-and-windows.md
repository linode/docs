# Introduction to Git

Git was designed and developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) for Linux kernel development. Git provides support for non-linear, distributed development, allowing multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously. Git is the most popular distributed version control and source code management system.

This guide explains how to install the latest, stable, prepackaged version `git` on GNU/Linux, Mac Osx, and Windows, using their respective package managers. Git can also be [compiled from source and installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_from_source) on any operating system.

For more information about using and configuring Git, see our [Getting Started with Git](/docs/development/version-control/how-to-configure-git/) guide.

### Install Git via Homebrew

If Homebrew is already installed, begin with Step 6.

If MacPorts is already installed, proceed directly to Step 9.

1.  Go to [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) website.
2.  Click on the link for your operating system.
3.  After the download completes, click on the file to start the installer.
4.  Click the **Continue** button to begin the install:

## Install Git on Windows

To install Git on Windows you will need to download the installer from the [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) website:

1. Download the most current version for your operating system by double clicking on the package name:

    ![Click to download version for Windows.](/docs/assets/1595-Git-Win-01.png)

2.  Select **Run** to begin the installation:

    ![Click Run to start the installer.](/docs/assets/1596-Git-Win-02.png)

3.  Click **Yes** to continue:

    ![Click Yes to continue.](/docs/assets/1597-Git-Win-03.png)

4.  Click **Next** to continue:

    ![Click Next to continue.](/docs/assets/1598-Git-Win-04.png)

5.  Click **Next** to continue:

    ![Click Next to continue.](/docs/assets/1599-Git-Win-05.png)

6.  If you need to change the installation folder, click **Browse** and select a new location. To accept the default location click on **Next**:

    ![Click Next for default or Browse to change.](/docs/assets/1600-Git-Win-06.png)

7.  To accept the default components to be installed click **Next**. Otherwise, select the additional components to be installed before clicking the **Next** button:

    ![Accept the default or select additional components.](/docs/assets/1601-Git-Win-07.png)

    ![Select the start menu folder.](/docs/assets/1602-Git-Win-08.png)

9.  Keep the default *line ending conversion* by clicking **Next**. To change the default, choose one of the two other choices before clicking **Next**:

    ![Select line ending conversions.](/docs/assets/1603-Git-Win-09.png)

     {: .note }
    >
    > It is strongly recommended that you keep the default settings for line ending conversions. Changing from the default may result in formatting problems when viewed on your Linode.

10. The program will now begin installing:

    ![Git is installing.](/docs/assets/1604-Git-Win-10.png)

11. Click **Finish** to exit the installer:

    ![Click Finish to exit.](/docs/assets/1605-Git-Win-11.png)

12. Once you open Git you can select either **Create New**, **Clone Existing** or **Open Existing Repository**. In this example, we create new repository:

    ![Create New Repository.](/docs/assets/1606-Git-Win-12.png)

13. Enter a directory name or click on **Browse** to navigate to a directory:

    ![Directory for a new repository.](/docs/assets/1607-Git-Win-13.png)

14. A blank repository is created:
