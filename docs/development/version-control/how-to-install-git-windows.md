To install Git on Windows you will need to download the installer from the [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) website:

1. Download the most current version for your operating system by double clicking on the package name:

6.  If you need to change the installation folder, click **Browse** and select a new location. To accept the default location click on **Next**:

    ![Click Next for default or Browse to change.](/docs/assets/1600-Git-Win-06.png)

7.  To accept the default components to be installed click **Next**. Otherwise, select the additional components to be installed before clicking the **Next** button:

    ![Accept the default or select additional components.](/docs/assets/1601-Git-Win-07.png)

8.  Accept the default Start Menu folder by clicking **Next**, or use **Browse** to select a new folder location:

    ![Select the start menu folder.](/docs/assets/1602-Git-Win-08.png)

9.  Keep the default *line ending conversion* by clicking **Next**. To change the default, choose one of the two other choices before clicking **Next**:

    ![Select line ending conversions.](/docs/assets/1603-Git-Win-09.png)

     {{< note >}}
It is strongly recommended that you keep the default settings for line ending conversions. Changing from the default may result in formatting problems when viewed on your Linode.

10. The program will now begin installing:

11. Click **Finish** to exit the installer:

    ![Click Finish to exit.](/docs/assets/1605-Git-Win-11.png)

12. Once you open Git you can select either **Create New**, **Clone Existing** or **Open Existing Repository**. In this example, we create new repository:

    ![Create New Repository.](/docs/assets/1606-Git-Win-12.png)

13. Enter a directory name or click on **Browse** to navigate to a directory:

    ![Directory for a new repository.](/docs/assets/1607-Git-Win-13.png)

14. A blank repository is created:
