## Introduction to Git

Git was designed and developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) for Linux kernel development. Git provides support for non-linear, distributed development, allowing multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously. Git is the most popular distributed version control and source code management system.

This guide explains how to install the latest, stable, prepackaged version `git` on GNU/Linux, Mac Osx, and Windows, using their respective package managers. Git can also be [compiled from source and installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_from_source) on any operating system.

For more information about using and configuring Git, see our [Getting Started with Git](/docs/development/version-control/how-to-configure-git/) guide.
