Java is a powerful programming language. Software written in Java can compile and run on any system. Unlike Python or C, Java does not come pre-installed on Linode distribution images. This guide installs the OpenJDK 8 runtime environment and development kit in CentOS 7. OpenJDK is the free and open-source implementation of the Java SE Development Kit.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible.

3.  Update your system:

		sudo yum update

## Install Java Runtime Environment (Java JRE)

If you don't plan on using Java to write software, the JRE is all you need. In CentOS, the JRE package is `java-$(version)-openjdk`. The `openjdk-headless` package contains a minimal implementation of the JDK for executing Java applications on the command line. In this example, you'll install the minimal version of OpenJDK 8.

	sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless

After the installation finishes, verify its completion using `yum list installed | grep "java"`. The output should be:

    java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless.x86_64   1:1.8.0.131-3.b12.el7_3           @updates
    javapackages-tools.noarch            3.4.1-11.el7                      @base
    python-javapackages.noarch           3.4.1-11.el7                      @base
    tzdata-java.noarch                   2017b-1.el7                       @updates

## Install the Java Development Kit (Java JDK)

If you plan on using Java to write or edit programs on your Linode, install the JDK.

	sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

After the installation finishes, verify its completion using `yum list installed | grep "openjdk-devel"`. The output should be:

	java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64      1:1.8.0.131-3.b12.el7_3           @updates

You can also verify by running the Java compiler, `javac`. If you need to compile Java code on your Linode, run `javac foobar.java`. Then, run the application with `java foobar`.
