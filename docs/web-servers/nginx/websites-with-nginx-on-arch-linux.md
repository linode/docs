title: Websites with Nginx on Arch Linux
---

Nginx is a lightweight and high performance web server, designed with the purpose of delivering large amounts of static content quickly and with efficient use of system resources. In contrast to the [Apache HTTP server](/docs/web-servers/apache/), which uses a threaded or process-oriented approach to handling requests, nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven model to provide more predictable performance under load.

Before you begin installing the nginx web server, it is assumed that you have followed our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/). If you're new to Linux server administration, you may be interested in our [introduction to Linux concepts guide](/docs/tools-reference/introduction-to-linux-concepts), our [beginner's guide](/docs/beginners-guide/), and our [administration basics guide](/docs/using-linux/administration-basics).

Set the Hostname
----------------

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Installing nginx
----------------

Nginx is included in the Arch Linux software repositories. Issue following sequence of commands ensure that your system's package manager and databases are up to date:

    pacman -Sy
    pacman -S pacman

Install the nginx web server by issuing the following command:

    pacman -S nginx

Edit the `/etc/rc.conf` file, adding "nginx" to the "DEAMONS=" line as shown in the following excerpt:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/rc.conf

> DAEMONS=(syslog-ng network netfs crond sshd ntpd nginx)

To start the server for the first time, use the following command:

    /etc/rc.d/nginx start

Congratulations! You now have a running and fully functional HTTP server powered by nginx. Continue reading our introduction to [basic nginx configuration](/docs/websites/nginx/basic-nginx-configuration) for more information about using and setting up the web server.
