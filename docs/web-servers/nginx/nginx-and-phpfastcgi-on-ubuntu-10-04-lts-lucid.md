The nginx web server is a fast, lightweight server designed to efficiently handle the needs of both low and high traffic websites. Although commonly used to serve static content, it's quite capable of handling dynamic pages as well. This guide will help you get nginx up and running with PHP via FastCGI on your Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid) Linode.

It is assumed that you've already followed the steps outlined in our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/). These steps should be performed via a root login to your Linode over SSH.

Set the Hostname
----------------

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Install Required Packages
-------------------------

Issue the following commands to update your system and install the nginx web server, PHP, and compiler tools:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install nginx php5-cli php5-cgi spawn-fcgi psmisc

Configure Virtual Hosting
-------------------------

### Create Directories

In this guide, the domain "example.com" is used as an example site. You should substitute your own domain name in the configuration steps that follow. First, create directories to hold content and log files:

    mkdir -p /srv/www/www.example.com/public_html
    mkdir /srv/www/www.example.com/logs
    chown -R www-data:www-data /srv/www/www.example.com

### UNIX Sockets Configuration Example

Next, you'll need to define the site's virtual host file. This example uses a UNIX socket to connect to fcgiwrap. Be sure to change all instances of "example.com" to your domain name.

{: .file }
/etc/nginx/sites-available/www.example.com
:   ~~~ nginx
    server {
        server_name www.example.com example.com;
        access_log /srv/www/www.example.com/logs/access.log;
        error_log /srv/www/www.example.com/logs/error.log;
        root /srv/www/www.example.com/public_html;

        location / {
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fastcgi/php-fastcgi.socket;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /srv/www/www.example.com/public_html$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
    }
    ~~~

Create a file named `/usr/bin/php-fastcgi` with the following contents:

{: .file }
/usr/bin/php-fastcgi
:   ~~~ bash
    #!/bin/bash

    FASTCGI_USER=www-data
    FASTCGI_GROUP=www-data
    SOCKET=/var/run/php-fastcgi/php-fastcgi.socket
    PIDFILE=/var/run/php-fastcgi/php-fastcgi.pid
    CHILDREN=6
    PHP5=/usr/bin/php5-cgi

    /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -s $SOCKET -P $PIDFILE -C $CHILDREN -u $FASTCGI_USER -g $FASTCGI_GROUP -f $PHP5
    ~~~

Make it executable by issuing the following command:

    chmod +x /usr/bin/php-fastcgi

### TCP Sockets Configuration Example

Alternately, you may wish to use TCP sockets instead. If so, modify your nginx virtual host configuration file to resemble the following example. Again, make sure to replace all instances of "example.com" with your domain name.

{: .file }
/etc/nginx/sites-available/www.example.com
:   ~~~ nginx
    server {
        server_name www.example.com example.com;
        access_log /srv/www/www.example.com/logs/access.log;
        error_log /srv/www/www.example.com/logs/error.log;
        root /srv/www/www.example.com/public_html;

        location / {
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /srv/www/www.example.com/public_html$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
    }
    ~~~

Create a file named `/usr/bin/php-fastcgi` with the following contents:

{: .file }
/usr/bin/php-fastcgi
:   ~~~ bash
    #!/bin/bash

    FASTCGI_USER=www-data
    FASTCGI_GROUP=www-data
    ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
    PORT=9000
    PIDFILE=/var/run/php-fastcgi/php-fastcgi.pid
    CHILDREN=6
    PHP5=/usr/bin/php5-cgi

    /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -a $ADDRESS -p $PORT -P $PIDFILE -C $CHILDREN -u $FASTCGI_USER -g $FASTCGI_GROUP -f $PHP5
    ~~~

Make it executable by issuing the following command:

    chmod +x /usr/bin/php-fastcgi

### Important Security Considerations

If you're planning to run applications that support file uploads (images, for example), the above configurations may expose you to a security risk by allowing arbitrary code execution. The short explanation for this behavior is that a properly crafted URI which ends in ".php", in combination with a malicious image file that actually contains valid PHP, can result in the image being processed as PHP.

To mitigate this issue, you may wish to modify your configuration to include a `try_files` directive. Please note that this fix requires nginx and the php-fcgi workers to reside on the same server.

~~~ nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    try_files $uri =404;
    include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fastcgi/php-fastcgi.socket;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /srv/www/www.example.com/public_html$fastcgi_script_name;
}
~~~

Additionally, it's a good idea to secure any upload directories your applications may use. The following configuration excerpt demonstrates securing an "/images" directory.

~~~ nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    if ($uri !~ "^/images/") {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fastcgi/php-fastcgi.socket;
    }
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /srv/www/www.example.com/public_html$fastcgi_script_name;
}
~~~

### Enable and Start Services

Issue the following commands to enable the site:

    cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/www.example.com

Create a file named `/etc/init.d/php-fastcgi` with the following contents:

{: .file }
/etc/init.d/php-fastcgi
:   ~~~ bash
    #!/bin/bash

    PHP_SCRIPT=/usr/bin/php-fastcgi
    FASTCGI_USER=www-data
    FASTCGI_GROUP=www-data
    PID_DIR=/var/run/php-fastcgi
    PID_FILE=/var/run/php-fastcgi/php-fastcgi.pid
    RET_VAL=0

    case "$1" in
        start)
          if [[ ! -d $PID_DIR ]]
          then
            mkdir $PID_DIR
            chown $FASTCGI_USER:$FASTCGI_GROUP $PID_DIR
            chmod 0770 $PID_DIR
          fi
          if [[ -r $PID_FILE ]]
          then
            echo "php-fastcgi already running with PID `cat $PID_FILE`"
            RET_VAL=1
          else
            $PHP_SCRIPT
            RET_VAL=$?
          fi
      ;;
        stop)
          if [[ -r $PID_FILE ]]
          then
            kill `cat $PID_FILE`
            rm $PID_FILE
            RET_VAL=$?
          else
            echo "Could not find PID file $PID_FILE"
            RET_VAL=1
          fi
      ;;
        restart)
          if [[ -r $PID_FILE ]]
          then
            kill `cat $PID_FILE`
            rm $PID_FILE
            RET_VAL=$?
          else
            echo "Could not find PID file $PID_FILE"
          fi
          $PHP_SCRIPT
          RET_VAL=$?
      ;;
        status)
          if [[ -r $PID_FILE ]]
          then
            echo "php-fastcgi running with PID `cat $PID_FILE`"
            RET_VAL=$?
          else
            echo "Could not find PID file $PID_FILE, php-fastcgi does not appear to be running"
          fi
      ;;
        *)
          echo "Usage: php-fastcgi {start|stop|restart|status}"
          RET_VAL=1
      ;;
    esac
    exit $RET_VAL
    ~~~

Start php-fastcgi and nginx by issuing the following commands:

    chmod +x /etc/init.d/php-fastcgi
    update-rc.d php-fastcgi defaults
    /etc/init.d/php-fastcgi start
    /etc/init.d/nginx start

Test PHP with FastCGI
---------------------

Create a file called "test.php" in your site's "public\_html" directory with the following contents:

{: .file }
/srv/www/example.com/www/public\_html/test.php
:   ~~~ php
    <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    ~~~

When you visit `http://www.example.com/test.php` in your browser, the standard "PHP info" output is shown. Congratulations, you've configured the nginx web server to use PHP-FastCGI for dynamic content!
