The WSGI specification provides a standard and efficient method for dynamic web applications to communicate with web servers. `mod_wsgi` provides a method for simply deploying WSGI applications with Apache. WSGI is used to deploy applications written with frameworks and tools like Django, Web.py, Werkzug, Chery.py, TurboGears, and Flask. These guides outline this installation and configuration process for deploying WSGI applications.

Set the Hostname
----------------

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Install Dependencies
--------------------

Issue the following commands to ensure that your system's package repositories and installed programs are up to date and that all required software is installed:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install apache2 python-setuptools libapache2-mod-wsgi

Your application may require additional dependencies. Install these either using the Ubuntu package tools or by using the `easy_install` command included in `python-setuptools` before proceeding.

Configure WSGI Handler
----------------------

In order for `mod_wsgi` to be able to provide access to your application, you will need to create a `application.wsgi` file inside of your application directory. The application directory should be located *outside* of your `DocumentRoot`. The following three sections each present a different `application.wsgi` example file to illustrate the basic structure of this file:

### Basic Hello World WSGI Configuration

In this example, the application is stored in `/srv/www/example.com/application` directory. Modify this example and all following examples to conform to the actual files and locations used in your deployment.

{: .file }
/srv/www/example.com/application/application.wsgi
:   ~~~ python
    import os
    import sys

    sys.path.append('/srv/www/example.com/application')

    os.environ['PYTHON_EGG_CACHE'] = '/srv/www/example.com/.python-egg'

    def application(environ, start_response):
        status = '200 OK'
        output = 'Hello World!'

        response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain'),
                            ('Content-Length', str(len(output)))]
        start_response(status, response_headers)

        return [output]
    ~~~

You must append the path of your application to the system path as above. The declaration of the `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` variable is optional but may be required for some applications when WSGI scripts are executed with the permissions of the web server. The WSGI application must be callable as `application`, regardless of how the application code is structured.

### Web.py WSGI Configuration

Consider the following example Web.py *application* which is embedded in a `application.wsgi` file. The [Web.py Framework](/docs/websites/frameworks/webpy-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/) must be installed in order for the following application to run successfully.

{: .file-excerpt }
/srv/www/example.com/application/application.wsgi
:   ~~~ python
    import web

    urls = (
        '/(.*)', 'hello'
    )

    class hello:
        def GET(self, name):
            if not name:
                name = 'World'
            return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

    app = web.application(urls, globals(), autoreload=False)
    application = app.wsgifunc()
    ~~~

### Django WSGI Configuration

Consider the following example `application.wsgi` file for Django applications:

{: .file-excerpt }
/srv/www/example.com/application/application.wsgi
:   ~~~ python
    import os
    import sys

    sys.path.append('/srv/www/example.com/application')

    os.environ['PYTHON_EGG_CACHE'] = '/srv/www/example.com/.python-egg'

    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'settings'

    import django.core.handlers.wsgi
    application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()
    ~~~

`Django` must be installed on your system and a working Django application before this example will function. The `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` points to the "`settings.py` file for your application, which would be located in the "`/srv/www/example.com/application/settings.py` in the case of this example.

Configure Apache
----------------

Deploy the following `VirtualHost` configuration and modify the paths and domains to reflect the requirements of your application:

{: .file-excerpt }
Apache `VirtualHost` Configuration
:   ~~~ apache
    <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName example.com
       ServerAlias www.example.com
       ServerAdmin username@example.com

       DocumentRoot /srv/www/example.com/public_html

       ErrorLog /srv/www/example.com/logs/error.log
       CustomLog /srv/www/example.com/logs/access.log combined

       WSGIScriptAlias / /srv/www/example.com/application/application.wsgi

       Alias /robots.txt /srv/www/example.com/public_html/robots.txt
       Alias /favicon.ico /srv/www/example.com/public_html/favicon.ico
       Alias /images /srv/www/example.com/public_html/images
       Alias /static /srv/www/example.com/public_html/static
    </VirtualHost>
    ~~~

In this example, the `WSGIScriptAlias` directive tells Apache that for this `VirtualHost`, all requests below `/` should be handled by the WSGI script specified. The series of four `Alias` directives allow Apache to serve the `robots.txt` and `favicon.ico` files as well as all resources beneath the `/images` and `/static` locations, directly from the `DocumentRoot` without engaging the WSGI application. You can add as many `Alias` directives as you require.

When you have configured your Apache `VirtualHost`, issue the following command to restart the web server:

    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

You will need to restart the web server every time the `application.wsgi` file changes. However, all other modifications to your application do not require a web server restart. Congratulations! You have now successfully deployed a WSGI application using `mod_wsgi`.
