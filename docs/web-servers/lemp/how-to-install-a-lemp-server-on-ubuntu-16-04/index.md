## What is a LEMP Stack?

The LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP) is a popular server configuration for developing and hosting web applications. The four components of the stack are not tightly coupled, making it possible to substitute your preferred technologies. The LEMP stack is a common variant in which the Apache web server is replaced by NGINX.

## Before You Begin

1.  You will need root access to the system, or a user account with `sudo` privilege.
2.  Set your system's [hostname](/docs/getting-started/#setting-the-hostname).
3.  Update your system.

## Installation

### NGINX

{{< content "install-nginx-ubuntu-ppa" >}}

### MariaDB

1.  Install the MariaDB server and MySQL/MariaDB-PHP support. You may be prompted to set a root password during installation.

        sudo apt install mariadb-server php7.0-mysql

2.  Run the *[mysql_secure_installation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/mysql_secure_installation/)* script:

        sudo mysql_secure_installation

     If you were not prompted to create a MySQL root user password when installing MariaDB, answer the script **Y** to set one.

     Answer **Y** at the following prompts:

     -  Remove anonymous users?
     -  Disallow root login remotely?
     -  Remove test database and access to it?
     -  Reload privilege tables now?

3.  Log in to MariaDB's SQL shell. Enter the `root` user's password when prompted.

        mysql -u root -p

4.  Create a test database and user with access permission. Replace `testdb` and `testuser` with appropriate names for your setup. Replace `password` with a strong password.

    {{< highlight sql >}}
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
CREATE USER 'testuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON testdb.* TO 'testuser';
quit
{{< /highlight >}}

### PHP

1.  Install the PHP FastCGI Processing Manager, which will bring in the core PHP dependencies:

        sudo apt install php7.0-fpm

2.  Tell PHP to only accept URIs for files that actually exist on the server. This mitigates a security vulnerability where the PHP interpreter can be tricked into allowing arbitrary code execution if the requested `.php` file is not present in the filesystem. See [this tutorial](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/?highlight=pitfalls#passing-uncontrolled-requests-to-php) for more information about this vulnerability.

        sudo sed -i 's/;cgi.fix_pathinfo=1/cgi.fix_pathinfo=0/g' /etc/php/7.0/fpm/php.ini

3.  Ownership of PHP's listening UNIX sockets is set to `www-data` by default, but they need to match the user and group NGINX is running as. If you installed NGINX from the NGINX repository as done above, NGINX will be using the `nginx` user and group.
Change the `listen` variables in `www.conf` to that:

        sudo sed -i 's/listen.owner = www-data/listen.owner = nginx/g' /etc/php/7.0/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/listen.group = www-data/listen.group = nginx/g' /etc/php/7.0/fpm/pool.d/www.conf


## Set an NGINX Site Configuration File

1. Create a root directory where the site's content will live. Replace *example.com* with your site's domain.

        sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/

2.  Disable the default site configuration provided with the package as an example. Or if you have no use for it, delete it.

        sudo mv /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf.disabled

3.  Website configuration files should be kept in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`. Create a configuration file for your site. Again replace *example.com* with your site's domain.

    {{< file "/etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf" nginx >}}
server {
    listen         80 default_server;
    listen         [::]:80 default_server;
    server_name    example.com www.example.com;
    root           /var/www/example.com;
    index          index.html;

    location / {
      try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~* \.php$ {
      fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
      include         fastcgi_params;
      fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME    $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
      fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_NAME        $fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
{{< /file >}}

    Here's a breakdown of the `server` block above:

    -  NGINX is listening on port 80 for incoming connections to *example.com* or *www.example.com*.

    -  The site is served out of `/var/www/example.com/` and it's index page (`index.html`) is a simple `.html` file. If your index page will use PHP, substitute `index.php` for `index.html`.

    -  `try_files` tells NGINX to verify that a requested file or directory [actually exist](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#try_files) in the site's root filesystem before further processing the request. If it does not, a `404` is returned.

    -  `location ~* \.php$` means that NGINX will apply this configuration to all .php files (file names are not case sensitive) in your siteâ€™s root directory, including any subdirectories containing PHP files.

    -  The `*` in the `~* \.php$` location directive indicates that PHP file names are not case sensitive. This can be removed if you prefer to enforce letter case.

    -  `fastcgi_pass` specifics the [UNIX socket](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_pass) where PHP listens for incoming connections from other local processes

    -  `include fastcgi_params` tells NGINX to process a list of `fastcgi_param` variables at `/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params`.

    -  The `fastcgi_param` directives contain the [location](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#variables) (relative to the site's root directory) and file [naming convention](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_index) of PHP scripts to be served when called by NGINX.

## Test the LEMP Stack

1.  Restart PHP and reload the NGINX configuration:

        sudo systemctl restart php7.0-fpm
        sudo nginx -s reload

2.  Create a test page to verify NGINX can render PHP and connect to the MySQL database. Replace the `"testuser"` and `"password"` fields with the MySQL credentials you created above.

    {{< file "/var/www/example.com/test.php" php >}}
<html>
<head>
    <h2>LEMP Stack Test</h2>
</head>
    <body>
    <?php echo '<p>Hello,</p>';

    // Define PHP variables for the MySQL connection.
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "testuser";
    $password = "password";

    // Create a MySQL connection.
    $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password);

    // Report if the connection fails or is successful.
    if (!$conn) {
        exit('<p>Your connection has failed.<p>' .  mysqli_connect_error());
    }
    echo '<p>You have connected successfully.</p>';
    ?>
</body>
</html>

{{< /file >}}

2.  Go to `http://example.com/test.php` in a web browser. It should report that *You have connected successfully*. If you see an error message or if the page does not load at all, re-check your configuration.

3.  Remove the test file once the stack is verified to be working correctly:

        sudo rm /var/www/example.com/test.php
