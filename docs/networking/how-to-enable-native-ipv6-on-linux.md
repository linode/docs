Linode provides IPv6 support in all of our data centers, and all Linodes are created with one IPv6 address. By default, IPv6 is enabled on all Linodes and the IPv6 address is acquired via Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC). To find your Linode's IPv6 address, click on the [Remote Access](/docs/networking/remote-access) tab of the Linode's dashboard.

It is important to note that Linode does not offer private IPv6 address allocations. We have designed our IPv6 accounting so that local IPv6 traffic does not count against your transfer quota and you can use them just like private IPv6 addresses.

## What is IPv6?
Internet Protocol version 6 carries data packets from source to destination over disparate networks. Evolved from IPv4, IPv6 developed in hexadecimal format and contains 8 octets, accommodating up to 2128 possible node, or address, combinations, which facilitate expansive scalability.

> The steps provided in this guide require root privileges. It is assumed that you will run these commands as the root superuser. If you are not logged in as `root` you will need to prefix most commands with `sudo`. For more information on privileges see our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## Set up IPv6

The IPv6 address provided with your Linode will automatically assign itself to your Linode via SLAAC. Our system is set up to do this so that you will not need to statically configure your IPv6 address unless you have an IPv6 address pool.

To ensure that your IPv6 address has been correctly assigned to your Linode, you can use the following command:

    ip -6 addr show

This will show a block of text similar to:

    3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qlen 1000
          inet6 2001:db8:2000:aff0::/32 scope global
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          inet6 ff32:20:2001:db8::/96 scope link
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

The lines beginning with `inet6` show your IPv6 address block.

As displayed above, you will have inet6 blocks even if you only have one IPv6 address:

 * The first, ending in `global`, is the global IPv6 address which everyone can connect to.

 * The second, ending in `link`, is your link-local address. An IPv6 link-local address is a unicast address that can be automatically configured on any interface. The link-local is usually in the `fe80::/10` range, however to comply with [RFC 3849](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3849), the link-local address for this documentation is in the `ff32::/10` range.

If your Linode does not have the correct IPv6 address or an IPv6 address at all, you should verify that you have router advertisements enabled and you have disabled privacy extensions. In order to use Linode's SLAAC, your Linode will need to accept router advertisements. These settings are properly set in our distribution templates by default.

## Additional IPv6 Addresses

You can request additional IPv6 addresses at any time by opening a [support ticket](/docs/platform/support). Additional addresses are allotted in *pools*. Each pool size has a different number of IPv6 addresses. The IPv6 pool sizes Linode provides and their respective quantity of IPv6 addresses are below.

{: .table .table-striped }
| Pool   | No. of IPS                    |
|:-------|------------------------------:|
| /56    | 4,722,366,482,869,645,213,696 |
| /64    | 18,446,744,073,709,551,616    |
| /116   | 4,096                         |
|--------|-------------------------------|

### IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

Each /56 or /64 IPv6 address pool is routed to a specific Linode. If you want to use that same address pool across multiple Linodes, you can by using neighbor discovery. In order to take advantage of neighbor discovery you must configure your Linode to act as a router by changing the value of `net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding`. Check your distribution's documentation for information on where to find this setting, as the location varies between different systems.

{: .caution}
>This creates a single point of failure for your infrastructure. If a Linode set up in this way were to crash, lose networking, or encounter any another disruption in service, your entire IPv6 network will also be interrupted.

Unlike the other pools available, /116 IPv6 address pools route to all of the Linodes on your account within the same data center as the Linode to which the pool is assigned. This means there is no single point of failure.

## Add IPv6 Addresses

While default IPv6 addresses are configured automatically, you will need to statically configure each IPv6 address in the pool you request.

{: .note}
>If SLAAC is not obtaining your IPv6 address, even after verifying that privacy extensions are disabled and your Linode is accepting router advertisements, you may need to statically configure your default IPv6 address as well.
>
> Be sure that [Network Helper](/docs/platform/network-helper) is disabled when adding addresses from a pool, otherwise your configuration files may be overwritten upon rebooting your Linode, causing disruption to your IPv6 networking.


### Debian / Ubuntu

{: .note}
> Be sure that [Network Helper](/docs/platform/network-helper) is disabled when adding addresses from a pool, otherwise your configuration files may be overwritten upon rebooting your Linode, causing disruption to your IPv6 networking.

1.  On Debian and Ubuntu, edit `/etc/network/interfaces` to set up statically configured IPv6:

    {: .file }
    /etc/network/interfaces
    : ~~~
      # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
      # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

      # The loopback network interface
      auto lo
      iface lo inet loopback

      # The primary network interface (eth0)
      auto eth0
      iface eth0 inet dhcp

      # IPv6 Address Blocks
      # Add a static block for your default public IPv6 address, and include a directive for its gateway.

      iface eth0 inet6 static
        address 2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1/64
        gateway fe80::1

      # Add an additional block for each IPv6 address you need to configure.

      iface eth0 inet6 static
        address 2001:db8:2000:aff0::1/64

      iface eth0 inet6 static
        address 2001:db8:2000:aff0::2/64
      ~~~

        {: .note}
        >On Debian Jessie, your default IPv6 address provided by SLAAC will no longer be automatically assigned after you request a /64 pool. You will need to manually add it as a static address or IPv6 routing will not work.

2.  For /56 and /64 pools, addresses within your pool will be routed to your Linode's default IP address, or another Linode on your account in the same datacenter. You will see where the pool is routed under "Public IP Pools" within the Linode Manager's Remote Access tab. You must enable packet forwarding on that Linode to allow it to act as a router and enable external traffic from addresses within your IPv6 pool:

    {: .file}
    /etc/sysctl.conf
    : ~~~ conf
      # Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv6
      #  Enabling this option disables Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
      #  based on Router Advertisements for this host
      net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
      ~~~

    For addresses within a /116 pool, the above change is not necessary as routing will be automatically configured. Addresses in a /116 pool are routed to other Linodes on your account within the same datacenter.

3.  Restart networking. This command should be performed in [Lish](/docs/networking/using-the-linode-shell-lish), as it may terminate an SSH connection.

        ifdown -a && ifup -a

### CentOS/Fedora

On CentOS or Fedora, edit `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` to set up statically configured IPv6 addresses. You should configure [Static IP Networking](/docs/networking/linux-static-ip-configuration) for IPv4 as well.

{: .file }
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
: ~~~
  # Configuration for eth0
  DEVICE=eth0
  BOOTPROTO=none
  ONBOOT=yes

  # Adding a public IP address.
  # The netmask is taken from the PREFIX (where 24 is Public IP, 17 is Private IP)
  IPADDR0=198.51.100.5
  PREFIX0=24

  # Specifying the gateway
  GATEWAY0=198.51.100.1

  # Adding a second public IP address.
  IPADDR1=198.51.100.6
  PREFIX1=24

  # Adding a private IP address.
  IPADDR2=192.168.133.234
  PREFIX2=17

  IPV6INIT=yes
  # Adding IPv6 addresses from pool.
  IPV6ADDR_SECONDARIES="2001:db8:2000:aff0::1/64 2001:db8:2000:aff0::2/64 2001:db8:2000:aff0::3/64"
  ~~~

If you are using CentOS 6.5 or lower, restart networking:

    service network restart

If you are using CentOS 7 or Fedora:

    systemctl restart network

### Arch Linux (systemd-networkd)

If you are using `systemd-networkd` on Arch Linux, you can statically configure IPv6 pools by editing `/etc/systemd/network/05-eth0.network`.

1.  Set up [Static IP Networking](/docs/networking/linux-static-ip-configuration/##arch--coreos-container-linux) for your IPv4 address.

2.  Edit your current static IP networking configuration to allow for your IPv6 addresses. You will need to include your default IPv6 address as well.

    {: .file }
    /etc/systemd/network/05-eth0.network
    :   ~~~
        [Match]
        Name=eth0

        [Network]
        Address=198.51.100.2/24
        Address=192.168.133.234/17
        Gateway=198.51.100.1
        Address=2001:db8:2000:aff0::/32
        Address=2001:db8:2000:aff0::1/32
        Address=2001:db8:2000:aff0::2/32
        ~~~

3.  Restart `systemd-networkd`

        systemctl restart systemd-networkd

### Arch Linux (netctl)

If you are still using `netctl` in Arch Linux, you can statically configure your IPv6 pools by editing the `/etc/netctl/examples/ethernet-static` file and copying it to `/etc/netctl`.

1.  Copy and rename one of the sample network profiles to the `netctl` directory:

        cp /etc/netctl/examples/ethernet-dhcp /etc/netctl/ethernet-static

2.  Edit your newly copied file, entering your IPv6 networking information (e.g. IP address, gateway, etc.).

    {: .file }
    /etc/netctl/ethernet-static
    :   ~~~
        Description='A basic static ethernet connection'
            Interface=eth0
            Connection=ethernet

            ## IPv4 Static Configuration
            IP=static
            Address=('198.51.100.2/24' '192.168.133.234/17')
            Gateway='198.51.100.1'

            ## For IPv6 autoconfiguration
            #IP6=stateless

            ## For IPv6 static address configuration
            IP6=static
            Address6=('2001:db8:2000:aff0::1/32')
            Gateway6='fe80::1'

            ## DNS resolvers
            DNS=('198.51.100.6' '198.51.100.7' '198.51.100.8')
        ~~~

3.  Enable your new network profile:

        netctl enable ethernet-static

### Gentoo

The configuration of additional IPv6 addresses in Gentoo is simple. Append the IPv6 addresses and netmask you want to the `config_eth0` line in `/etc/conf.d/net`. The list itself is a space separated list.

{: .file }
/etc/conf.d/net
:   ~~~
    # This blank configuration will automatically use DHCP for any net.*
    # scripts in /etc/init.d.  To create a more complete configuration,
    # please review /usr/share/doc/openrc*/net.example* and save your configuration
    # in /etc/conf.d/net (this file :]!).
    config_eth0="dhcp 2001:db8:2000:aff0::1/32 2001:db8:2000:aff0::2/32 2001:db8:2000:aff0::3/32"
    ~~~

## Maintain Static IP Configurations

If the "Auto-configure Networking" option is turned on in your Linode Manager, you may lose changes to static IP configurations upon rebooting your system. Before disabling it completely, please refer to our [Network Helper guide](/docs/platform/network-helper) for information on how to restore previous configurations. This will help mitigate issues that may arise if other files affected by the Network Helper are modified. You can also manually back up your configuration and restore it each time you reboot to avoid losing changes.
