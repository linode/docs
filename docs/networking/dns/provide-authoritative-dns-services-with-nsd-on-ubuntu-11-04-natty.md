NSD is a light-weight yet full-featured open source name server daemon created to provide an alternative to BIND.

Before beginning, you should be familiar with basic [DNS terminology and records](/docs/dns-guides/introduction-to-dns). You will also need to ensure that your current Linode plan has enough memory to run the NSD daemon. Use the developer's [memory usage calculator](http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/nsd-memsize.html) to determine the memory requirement for your NSD deployment.

Set the Hostname
----------------

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

Install Required Software
-------------------------

Ensure that your package repositories are up to date and that you've installed all available software upgrades by issuing the following commands:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded

Install NSD with the following commands:

    mkdir /etc/nsd3/
    touch /etc/nsd3/nsd.conf
    apt-get install nsd3

You will now need to configure the daemon.

Configure NSD
-------------

### Configure NSD Service

Edit the `nsd.conf` file to configure the behavior of the NSD service and the hosted DNS zones. The NSD package provides an example configuration file located at `/etc/nsd3/nsd.conf.sample` that you may reference. Your file should resemble the following:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/nsd3/nsd.conf

> server:
> :   logfile: "/var/log/nsd.log" username: nsd
>
### Host Zones with NSD

You must specify at least one zone in the `/etc/nsd3/nsd.conf` file before NSD will begin serving DNS records. Refer to the following example configuration for proper syntax.

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/nsd3/nsd.conf

> zone:
> :   name: example.com zonefile: /etc/nsd3/example.com.zone
>
> zone:
> :   name: example.org zonefile: /etc/nsd3/example.org.zone
>
Once zones are added to the `nsd.conf` file, proceed to create a zone file for each DNS zone.

Creating Zone Files
-------------------

Each domain has a zone file specified in the `nsd.conf` file. The syntax of an NSD zone file is similar BIND zone files. Refer to the example zone files that follow for syntax, and modify domain names and IP addresses to reflect the needs of your deployment.

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/nsd/example.com.zone

> \$ORIGIN example.com. \$TTL 86400
>
> @ IN SOA ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
> :   2010011801 ; serial number 28800 ; Refresh 7200 ; Retry 864000 ; Expire 86400 ; Min TTL )
>
> NS ns1.example.com.
> :   NS ns2.example.com.
>
>     MX 10 mail.example.com.
>
> ns1 IN A 11.22.33.44 ns2 IN A 22.33.44.55 www IN A 77.66.55.44 tomato IN A 77.66.55.44 mail IN A 88.77.66.55 \* IN A 77.66.55.44

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/nsd/example.org.zone

> \$ORIGIN example.org. \$TTL 86400
>
> @ IN SOA ns1.example.org. web-admin.example.org. (
> :   2009011803 ; serial number 28800 ; Refresh 7200 ; Retry 864000 ; Expire 86400 ; Min TTL )
>
> NS ns1.example.org.
> :   NS ns2.example.org.
>
>     MX 10 mail.example.org.
>
> ns1 IN A 11.22.33.44 ns2 IN A 22.33.44.55 www IN A 44.33.22.11 paisano IN A 44.33.22.11 mail IN A 99.88.77.66
>
> pizzapie IN CNAME paisano

Rebuild the NSD database and restart the daemon with following command sequence:

    nsdc rebuild
    /etc/init.d/nsd3 restart

Rebuild the database and restart NSD each time you edit an existing zone or create a new one.

Issue the following command to test the DNS server:

    dig @localhost www.example.org

The output should resemble the following:

    ; <<>> DiG 9.6.1-P2 <<>> @localhost pizzapie.example.org
    ; (1 server found)
    ;; global options: +cmd
    ;; Got answer:
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 25199
    ;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, ORGNAMEITY: 2, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available

    ;; QUESTION SECTION:

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    pizzapie.example.org. 86400 IN  CNAME   paisano.example.org.
    paisano.example.org. 86400  IN  A   44.33.22.11

    ;; ORGNAMEITY SECTION:
    example.org.    86400   IN  NS  ns1.example.org.
    example.org.    86400   IN  NS  ns2.example.org.

    ;; Query time: 18 msec

Congratulations, you have successfully installed NSD!

Adjusting NSD for Low-Memory Situations
---------------------------------------

If you are running NSD in a low-memory environment, amending the values of the following directives in your `/etc/nsd3/nsd.conf` file will lower your memory and system resource usage.

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/nsd3/nsd.conf

> ip4-only: yes tcp-count: 10 server-count: 1
