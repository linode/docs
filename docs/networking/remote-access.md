The Remote Access section of the Linode Manager contains important network settings for your Linode. Use this tab to find your IP address, set the reverse DNS, configure IP failover, and swap IP addresses with another Linode. You can also access the Linode Shell (Lish) console to remotely connect to your Linode and troubleshoot problems.

## Network Access

The Network Access section provides access to the settings for reverse DNS, IP failover, and swapping IP addresses. It also displays your Linode's IP addresses, default gateways, and DNS resolvers.

## Setting Reverse DNS

The ability to associate an IP address with a domain name is referred to as *forward* DNS resolution. *Reverse* DNS lookup is the inverse process, where an IP address resolves to its designated domain name. Official Internet documents state that "every Internet-reachable host should have a name," and that the name should match a reverse pointer record. (See [RFC 1033](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1033) and [RFC 1912](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1912).)

Here's how to set reverse DNS for your domain names:

{{< note >}}
Before setting reverse DNS, verify that you have created a matching forward DNS record for the IP address. For instructions, see [Adding DNS Records](/docs/hosting-website#sph_adding-dns-records). If you use a third-party DNS provider, create the forward DNS record with your provider's management tool.
{{< /note >}}

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).
2.  Click the **Linodes** tab.
3.  Select your Linode. The Linode's dashboard appears.
4.  Click the **Remote Access** tab.
5.  Select the **Reverse DNS** link, as shown in the below image.

	[![The Reverse DNS link](/docs/assets/1697-remoteaccess_reversedns.png)](/docs/assets/1697-remoteaccess_reversedns.png)

6.  Enter a domain name in the **Hostname** field, as shown in the below image.

	[![Adding the domain name for reverse DNS](/docs/assets/1695-ptr_lookup_marked.png)](/docs/assets/1695-ptr_lookup_marked.png)

7.  Click **Look up**. A message appears indicating that a match has been found for both your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

	[![Reverse DNS Match found](/docs/assets/1691-ptr_lookup_match_found_small.png)](/docs/assets/1692-ptr_lookup_match_found.png)

8.  Click **Yes** beneath the desired address. Note that you can select only one address at a time. If you want to set up reverse DNS for both the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, you can perform another lookup and select the other address.

9.  Repeat steps 1-8 for every other domain name you host on your Linode.

You have successfully configured reverse DNS.

 {{< note >}}
If you receive the message that **no match was found**, this indicates that you need to update the forward DNS for this domain. Make sure the domain or subdomain in question resolves to the IP address for which you are trying to set the reverse DNS. If you've recently made a DNS change, you may need to wait 24-48 hours for it to propagate.
{{< /note >}}

## Resetting Reverse DNS

To reset reverse DNS to the Linode domain, which will be something like **li12-345.members.linode.com**, follow these instructions:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).
2.  Click the **Linodes** tab.
3.  Select your Linode. The Linode's dashboard appears.
4.  Click the **Remote Access** tab.
5.  Select the **Reverse DNS** link, as shown in the below image.

	[![The Reverse DNS link](/docs/assets/1697-remoteaccess_reversedns.png)](/docs/assets/1697-remoteaccess_reversedns.png)

6.  Select the **Reset** link next to the reverse DNS setting you want to revert to the default Linode domain.

	[![The Reset link](/docs/assets/1694-ptr_reset_marked_small.png)](/docs/assets/1693-ptr_reset_marked.png)

7.  Click **Yes** when asked to confirm the reset.

You'll see a confirmation message that the reverse DNS has been reset.

## Configuring IP Failover

*IP failover* is the process by which an IP address is reassigned from one Linode to another in the event the first one fails or goes down. If you're using two Linodes to make a website [highly available](/docs/websites/introduction-to-high-availability) with Keepalived or a similar service, you can use the Linode Manager to configure IP failover. Here's how:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).
2.  Click the **Linodes** tab. A list of your available nodes will appear.
3.  Select the Linode on which you wish to configure failover. The Linode's dashboard appears.
4.  Click the **Remote Access** tab.
5.  Select the **IP Failover** link. The webpage shown below appears.

	[![Configuring IP failover](/docs/assets/963-remote-5.png)](/docs/assets/963-remote-5.png)

6.  Select the checkboxes of all IP addresses that need to fail over to the chosen Linode.
7.  Click **Save Changes**.

You have successfully configured IP failover. Now, when a failover service such as Keepalived detects failure of your chosen Linode, its IP address will be assigned to the new Linode to avoid an interruption in service. For more information on a practical use case, see our guide on [hosting a website with high availability](/docs/websites/host-a-website-with-high-availability).

## Networking Restrictions

Linode's philosophy is to provide a plain Internet connection to every customer. We also implement some networking restrictions to prevent malicious activity and the abuse of our service.

By default, Linodes are able to send and receive traffic only for the MAC and IP addresses they are assigned. This restriction also applies to all ARP and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery traffic.

If you want to allow one Linode to use another Linode's IP address, such as for a high availability setup, you will need to enable IP Failover in the Linode Manager for every Linode that needs to use the IP address. For more information on enabling IP Failover, please see the [previous section](#configuring-ip-failover) of this guide.

## Swapping IP Addresses

If you have two Linodes in the same data center, you can use the *IP swap* feature to switch their IP addresses. This could be useful in several situations. For example, if you've built a new server to replace an old one, you could swap IP addresses instead of updating the DNS records.

{{< note >}}
This process will only swap **IPv4** addresses, not IPv6.
{{< /note >}}

Here's how to swap IP addresses:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).
2.  Click the **Linodes** tab.
3.  Select a Linode. The Linode's dashboard appears.
4.  Click the **Remote Access** tab.
5.  Select the **IP Swap** link. The webpage shown below appears.

	[![Linode selection page for IP swap](/docs/assets/971-remote-8.png)](/docs/assets/971-remote-8.png)

6.  From the **With Linode** menu, select a Linode.

	{{< note >}}
The menu only displays Linodes hosted in the same data center as the current Linode.
{{< /note >}}

7.  Click **Select**. The webpage shown below appears.

	[![Adding the domain name for Reverse DNS](/docs/assets/961-remote-3-small.png)](/docs/assets/962-remote-3.png)

8.  Select both of the **Move It** checkboxes to verify that you want the IP addresses switched.
9.  Click **Do it**.
10. **Optional** Enable [Network Helper](/docs/platform/network-helper) and reboot your Linode.

    Network Helper automatically configures static IP address configuration files, and will update them with the new IP address. It's turned on by default for newer Linodes. For older Linodes, unless you've modified the networking configuration, DHCP assigns the IP address on boot.

    If Network Helper is turned off *and* you've [configured a static IP address](/docs/networking/linux-static-ip-configuration), you'll need to update the configuration for the new addresses, or turn Network Helper on.

    {{< note >}}
If the IP is unreachable after a few minutes, you may need to notify the router directly of the IP change with the `arp` command:

arping -c5 -I eth0 -b -A -s 198.51.100.10 198.51.100.1
ping -c5 -I 198.51.100.10 198.51.100.1

Replace `198.51.100.10` with your new IP address, and `198.51.100.1` with the gateway address listed in your Remote Access tab under "Default Gateways".

## Adding Private IP Addresses

The Linode Manager allows you to add private IP addresses for fast and secure connections between Linodes located in the same data center. Here's how to add a private IP address:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).
2.  Click the **Linodes** tab.
3.  Select a Linode. The Linode's dashboard appears.
4.  Click the **Remote Access** tab.
5.  Select the **Add a Private IP** link, as shown below.

	[![Adding Private IP addresses](/docs/assets/1696-remote_access_privateip.png)](/docs/assets/1696-remote_access_privateip.png)

6.  The Linode Manager assigns a private IP address to your Linode.
7.  Make sure [Network Helper](/docs/platform/network-helper) is enabled on your configuration profile. Otherwise, configure static networking. See the [Linux Static IP Configuration](/docs/networking/configuring-static-ip-interfaces) guide for instructions.

If you'd like to add more than one private IP address to your Linode, please [contact support](/docs/support).

## Adding Public IP Addresses

You can use the Linode Manager to add additional public IP addresses to your account. However, due to the [impending exhaustion of the IPv4 address space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion), Linode requires users to provide technical justification. To add another public IP address, please [contact support](/docs/support) with your justification.

## Console Access

The Lish console allows you to access your Linode at any time, even if you've messed up your network settings. To access Lish, use the Ajax console or an SSH client application installed on your computer. For more information about Lish, including usage tips, see [Using the Linode Shell](/docs/troubleshooting/using-lish-the-linode-shell).

### Using the Ajax Console

If you need to quickly access Lish, use the Ajax Console to open it directly from your web browser. Here's how:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).
2.  Click the **Linodes** tab.
3.  Select a Linode. The Linode's dashboard appears.
4.  Click the **Remote Access** tab. Scroll down to the *Console Access* section.
5.  Select the **Launch Lish Ajax Console** link.
6.  Enter a username and password to log in.

You are now logged in to the Lish Ajax console.

## Using SSH

You can also access Lish with an SSH client application installed on your computer. Here's how:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).
2.  Click the **Linodes** tab.
3.  Select a Linode. The Linode's dashboard appears.
4.  Click the **Remote Access** tab. Scroll down to the *Console Access* section, as shown below.

	[![The Console Access section of the Remote Access tab](/docs/assets/967-remote-6-small.png)](/docs/assets/968-remote-6.png)

5.  Accessing Lish via SSH requires additional authentication over and above your Linode's username and password. Enter a password for Lish in the **Lish via SSH Password** field, and then click **Change Password**. Or, if you use SSH key pair authentication, copy and paste your public key in to the **Lish via SSH Keys** field, and then click **Submit Keys**.
6.  Select the **Lish via SSH** link, as shown below.
7.  Your SSH client connects to your Linode via Lish. If you set a password for Lish, enter that first, and then enter a username and password to log in.

You are now logged in to Lish via SSH.
