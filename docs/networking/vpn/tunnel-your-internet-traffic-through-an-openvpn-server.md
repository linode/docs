This guide will show you how to configure an OpenVPN server to forward incoming traffic to the internet, then route the responses back to the client.

![Tunnel Your Internet Traffic Through an OpenVPN Server](/docs/assets/tunnel-traffic-through-openvpn.png "Tunnel Your Internet Traffic Through an OpenVPN Server")

Commonly, a VPN tunnel is used to privately access the internet, evading censorship or geolocation by shielding your computer's web traffic when connecting through untrusted hotspots, or connections.

## Before You Begin

This guide is the second-part  of a three-part series on setting up a  hardened OpenVPN environment. The guide assumes that you already have an OpenVPN server running. If you do not: complete part one of the series: [Set Up a Hardened OpenVPN Server with Debian](/docs/networking/vpn/set-up-a-hardened-openvpn-server). If you found this page looking for information about VPN client device configuration, see Part Three: [Configuring OpenVPN Client Devices](/docs/networking/vpn/configuring-openvpn-client-devices).

## OpenVPN Configuration

OpenVPN's server-side configuration file is: `/etc/openvpn/server.conf`, and requires editing to optimize its efficiency.

1.  Switch from your standard user account to the `root` user:

        sudo su - root

2.  Set OpenVPN to push a gateway configuration, so all clients send internet traffic through it.

        cat >> /etc/openvpn/server.conf << END

        # Clients are to use this server as a network gateway.
        push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
        END

3.  Push DNS resolvers to client devices. [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/) is provided by OpenVPN's `client.ovpn` template file.

        cat >> /etc/openvpn/server.conf << END

        # Push these DNS addresses to clients.
        push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222"
        push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"
        END


## Append Networking Rules

In [Part One](/docs/networking/vpn/set-up-a-hardened-openvpn-server) of this series, we set iptables rules so the OpenVPN server could only accept client connections, SSH, and make system updates, all over IPv4. [IPv6 was disabled](/docs/networking/vpn/set-up-a-hardened-openvpn-server#disable-ipv6) since OpenVPN doesn't support using both transport layers simultaneously. Leaving IPv6 disabled here prevents leaking v6 traffic which would otherwise be sent separately from your VPN's v4 tunnel.



{: .caution }
>
>The steps below will overwrite any custom IPv4 firewall rules you may have.

1.  Blank the v4 ruleset that you created in part one of this series.

        true > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

2.  Create a new IPv4 rule file using the ruleset below. The path `/etc/iptables/rules.v4` assumes Debian or Ubuntu with `iptables-persistent` installed.

    {: .file}
    /etc/iptables/rules.v4
    :   ~~~ conf
        *filter

        # Allow all loopback (lo) traffic and reject traffic
        # to localhost that does not originate from lo.
        -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
        -A INPUT ! -i lo -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j REJECT
        -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

        # Allow ping and ICMP error returns.
        -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT
        -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT

        # Allow SSH.
        -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 22 -j ACCEPT

        # Allow UDP traffic on port 1194.
        -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 1194 -j ACCEPT

        # Allow DNS resolution and limited HTTP/S on eth0.
        # Necessary for updating the server and keeping time.
        -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 53 -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
        -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 53 -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

        -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 80 -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
        -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 443 -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

        # Allow traffic on the TUN interface.
        -A INPUT -i tun0 -j ACCEPT
        -A FORWARD -i tun0 -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -o tun0 -j ACCEPT

        # Allow forwarding traffic only from the VPN.
        -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o eth0 -s 10.89.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
        -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

        # Log any packets which don't fit the rules above...
        # (optional but useful)
        -A INPUT -m limit --limit 3/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables_INPUT_denied: " --log-level 4
        -A FORWARD -m limit --limit 3/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables_FORWARD_denied: " --log-level 4
        -A OUTPUT -m limit --limit 3/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables_OUTPUT_denied: " --log-level 4

        # then reject them.
        -A INPUT -j REJECT
        -A FORWARD -j REJECT
        -A OUTPUT -j REJECT

        COMMIT
        ~~~

3.  Import the new ruleset:

        iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

4.  Apply the routing rule so that traffic can leave the VPN. This must be done after `iptables-restore` because that directive doesn't  take a table option:

        iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.89.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

5.  Save the currently loaded rules with `iptables-persistent`:

        dpkg-reconfigure iptables-persistent

6.  The kernel must then be told it can forward incoming IPv4 traffic:

        echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf

7.  Activate the sysctl change:

        sysctl -p

8.  Restart OpenVPN and exit the `root` user account:

        systemctl restart openvpn*
        exit

## Next Steps

Server-side configuration is complete but now the VPN clients need to be set up. Move on to part three: [Configuring OpenVPN Client Devices](/docs/networking/vpn/configuring-openvpn-client-devices).
