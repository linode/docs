title: Linux Static IP Configuration
---

Network configurations are generally assigned to a networked device in one of two methods, either by [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) or static assignments. These terms (and others) are often used when discussing IP addresses, but along with IPs, a basic network interface configuration usually needs DNS resolvers and routing as well.

Upon a Linode's creation, an IPv4 address is selected from a pool of available addresses from the datacenter your Linode is hosted in. Our [Network Helper](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/network-helper) is *enabled* by default for new Linodes, meaning that when you deploy a Linux distribution to your Linode and boot it, the host system detects which distro was selected and modifies the [network configuration files](/docs/platform/network-helper#what-files-are-affected) in the disk image to statically configure the Linode's IPv4 addresses, routing and DNS. Network Helper does not work with IPv6 so v6 addresses are assigned via SLAAC during deployment.

If Network Helper is *disabled* (or if your Linode was created before Network Helper became default), a Linode will be assigned its IPv4 network configuration by DHCP from the datacenter's networking hardware. One limitation of DHCP is that it can only assign one IP address per DHCP lease request. If you want additonal IPs for your Linode, static addressing must be used.

Due to the limited availablilty of IPv4 addresses, additional v4 addresses for your Linode must be requested by [contacting support](/docs/support) with a technical justification. Once approved, they can be added through the Remote Access tab of the Linode Manager and [additional IPv6 addresses](/docs/networking/native-ipv6-networking#additional-ipv6-addresses) are also available by submitting a support ticket.

An alternative to using the Linode Manager for static addressing is to manually configure within your Linux distribution, and it's this method which will be the focus of this guide. **Be aware that errors in network configurations can disconnect SSH sessions**, so it is advised that you use the [Linode Shell (Lish)](/docs/networking/using-the-linode-shell-lish) when making the changes below.


## General Network Configuration

Log in to the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com/) and go to the **Remote Access** tab.

From there you will see your Linode's:

*   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (both private and public).
*   [Netmask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork)
*   Default IPv4 gateway.
*   DNS resolvers.

Keep this information handy, because you'll need it as you configure your Linode's network settings.

[![Linode Manager / Remote Access](/docs/assets/1711-remote_access_ips_small.png)](/docs/assets/1710-remote_access_ips.png)

{: .note}
>
>Each Linode has only one virtual ethernet interface, *eth0*. Most outbound connections will still originate from the IP assigned to *eth0*, but if you need server daemons to bind to a particular IP address, you'll need to specify the correct IP in their configuration files.


## DNS Resolver Settings

If you've migrated your Linode to a new datacenter, you may need to edit your `resolv.conf` file so that your Linode can resolve DNS queries. Your DNS nameservers are listed under the **Remote Access** tab of the Linode Manager (see [the screenshot above](#general-network-configuration)).

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/resolv.conf
: ~~~ conf
  domain members.linode.com
  nameserver 203.0.113.9
  nameserver 203.0.113.10
  options rotate
  ~~~

*   **domain**: Sets the system's short hostname. The *search* domain also defaults to this domain as well since one is not explicity specified in the file.
*   **nameserver**: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of a DNS resolver from the Linode Manager you wish your system to use. You can specify as many nameservers as you like and use resolvers other than Linode's if you choose.
*   **options rotate**: The *rotate* option spreads DNS queries among the listed nameservers instead of always using the first available. This is useful in case any one DNS resolver experiences an outage.

For more info on `resolv.conf`, see [its manual page](http://linux.die.net/man/5/resolv.conf).


## Static IP Configuration

**Addressing**

The different IP blocks available to your Linode are:

*   Public IPv4 - /24
*   Private IPv4 - /17
*   IPv6 - /64

{: .note}
>
>Some Linux distributions determine their [netmask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork) based on the assigned IP address block.

**Gateways**

Although your Linode may have multiple IP addresses assigned using virtual interfaces, you should only specify a default gateway for *one* interface. The gateway should be on the same network as the desired IP address. For example, if you have the interface `eth0:3` assigned to the address `198.51.100.5`, you should use `198.51.100.1` as the gateway.

A default gateway should not be specified for private IP addresses. Additionally, the subnet mask for private IPs should be set to `255.255.128.0`, *not* `255.255.255.0`.

{: .caution}

>Using the examples below, be sure the IP addresses you enter reflect those shown under the **Remote Access** tab of the Linode Manager.

### Arch

There are multiple ways to configure static IP addresses in Arch. See the [Static IP Address](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_Configuration#Static_IP_address) section of Arch's Network Configuration Wiki page.

### CentOS 7 / Fedora 22+

Edit the interface's config file:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
:   ~~~ conf
    . . .

    GATEWAY=198.51.100.1

    # Your primary public IP address.
    # The netmask is taken from the PREFIX (where 24 is Public IP, 17 is Private IP).
    IPADDR0=198.51.100.5
    PREFIX0="24"

    # To add a second public IP address:
    IPADDR1=198.51.100.10
    PREFIX1="24"

    # To add a private IP address:
    IPADDR2=192.0.2.6
    PREFIX2="17"
    ~~~

### CentOS 6

CentOS 6 needs interface aliases specified in its config files. This means that additional IPs are assigned to an alias you create for *eth0* (for example, *eth0:1*, *etho0:2*, etc.). CentOS 6 keeps each interface configuration in a separate file at `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface_alias_name>` so you'll need to create one for *eth0*, **and** one for each alias you would like.
 
{: .file }
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
:   ~~~ conf
    # eth0
    DEVICE=eth0
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    
    # Your primary public IP address.
    IPADDR=198.51.100.5
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    GATEWAY=198.51.100.1
    ~~~

{: .file }
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:1
:   ~~~ conf
    # eth0:1
    DEVICE=eth0
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes

    # To add a second public IP address:
    IPADDR=198.51.100.10
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    ~~~

### Debian / Ubuntu

Edit the interface's config file:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/network/interfaces
:   ~~~ conf
    . . .

    # Your primary public IP address.
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 198.51.100.5/24
        gateway 198.51.100.1

    # To add a second public IP address:
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 198.51.100.10/24

    # To add a private IP address:
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.0.2.6/17
    ~~~

### Gentoo

Networking in Gentoo utilizes the `netifrc` utility. Addresses are specified in the `config_eth0` line and separated by spaces.

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/conf.d/net
:   ~~~ conf
    config_eth0="198.51.100.5/24 198.51.100.10/24 192.0.2.6/17"
    routes_eth0="default gw 198.51.100.1"
    . . .
    ~~~

### OpenSUSE

1.  Edit the interface's config file:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0
    : ~~~ conf
      . . .

      # Your primary public IP address.
      IPADDR='198.51.100.5'
      NETMASK='255.255.255.0'
      GATEWAY="198.51.100.1"

      # Add a second public IP address:
      IPADDR1='198.51.100.10'
      NETMASK1='255.255.255.0'
      LABEL1='1'

      # Add a private IP address:
      IPADDR2='192.0.2.6'
      NETMASK2='255.255.128.0'
      LABEL2='2'
      ~~~

2.  You will also need to add your gateway to the network routes file:

    {: .file }
    /etc/sysconfig/network/routes
    : ~~~
      # Destination   Gateway                 Netmask                 Device
      default         198.51.100.1            255.255.255.0           eth0
      ~~~


## Disable Network Helper

When manually assigning static IP addresses, [Network Helper](/docs/platform/network-helper) should be disabled to avoid it overwriting your `interfaces` file in the future.

1.  From the Linode Manager's **Dashboard**, choose **Edit** for the desired configuration profile.

    [![Linode Manager: Dashboard > Configuration Profile > Edit](/docs/assets/linode-dashboard-hilighted_small.png)](/docs/assets/linode-dashboard-hilighted.png)

2.  Scroll to the **Filesystem/Boot Helpers** section at the bottom of the page. The radio button for **Auto-configure Networking** should be set to **Yes** to indicate Network Helper is enabled. To disable it, select **No** and click **Save Changes**.

    [![Linode Manager: Dashboard > Configuration Profile > Edit](/docs/assets/network-helper-hilighted_small.png)](/docs/assets/network-helper-hilighted.png)


## Reboot Your Linode

It's best to reboot your Linode **from the Dashboard of the Linode Manager** rather than use `ifconfig` or an init system to restart the interfaces or distro's network services. This ensures that the new settings take effect without issues and that the networking services reliably start in full from the boot-up.


## Test Connectivity

1.  Log back into your Linode through SSH.

2.  Confirm that your `/etc/resolv.conf` exists and is correct.

3.  Ping each default IPv4 gateway listed on the **Remote Access** tab of the Linode Manager:

        ping -c 3 198.51.100.1
