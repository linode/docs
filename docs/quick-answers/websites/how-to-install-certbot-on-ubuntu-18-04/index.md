## What is Certbot?

Certbot is a tool that automates the process of getting a signed certificate via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/) to use with TLS.

For most operating system and web server configurations, Certbot creates signed certificates, manages the web server to accept secure connections, and can automatically renew certificates it has created. In most cases, Certbot can seamlessly enable HTTPS without causing server downtime.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have registered a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and set up [A and AAAA](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/#a-and-aaaa) DNS records that point to your Linode's public [IPv4 and IPv6 addresses](/docs/getting-started/#find-your-linode-s-ip-address). Consult our [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/) and [DNS Manager](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/) guides for help with setting up a domain.

{{< note >}}
If you're using Apache, change each instance of `nginx` to `apache` in the following sections.
{{< /note >}}

1. Install the Certbot and web server-specific packages, then run Certbot:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
        sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
        sudo certbot --nginx

1. Certbot will ask for information about the site. The responses will be saved as part of the certificate:

    # sudo certbot --nginx

1. Certbot will also ask if you would like to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS traffic. It is recommended that you select this option.

1. When the tool completes, Certbot will store all generated keys and issued certificates in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/$domain` directory, where `$domain` is the name of the domain entered during the Certbot certificate generation step.

    {{< note >}}
Certbot recommends pointing your web server configuration to the default certificates directory or creating symlinks. Keys and certificates should not be moved to a different directory.
{{< /note >}}

    Finally, Certbot will update your web server configuration so that it uses the new certificate, and also redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS if you chose that option.

1. If you have a firewall configured on your Linode, you may need to add [Firewall Rules](https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server/#configure-a-firewall) to allow incoming and outgoing connections to the HTTPS service. If you're using *UFW* for example, you can enable HTTP and HTTPS traffic with the following commands:

        sudo systemctl start ufw && sudo systemctl enable ufw
        sudo ufw allow http
        sudo ufw allow https
        sudo ufw enable

     {{< note >}}
For more information on UFW and how to install it on your Linode, see our [How to Configure a Firewall with UFW guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/security/firewalls/configure-firewall-with-ufw/)
