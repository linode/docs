## What is Certbot?

Certbot is a tool that automates the process of getting a signed certificate via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/) to use with TLS.

For most operating system and web server configurations, Certbot creates signed certificates, manages the web server to accept secure connections, and can automatically renew certificates it has created. In most cases, Certbot can seamlessly enable HTTPS without causing server downtime.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) with a DNS A/AAA record pointing to the domain's Public IP address. Consult [Add DNS Records](https://www.linode.com/docs/websites/hosting-a-website/#add-dns-records) for more information.
