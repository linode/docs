## What is systemctl?

`systemctl` is a controlling interface and inspection tool for the widely-adopted init system and service manager systemd. This guide will cover how to use `systemctl` to manage systemd services, work with systemd Targets and extract meaningful information about your system's overall state.

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## Managing Services

`systemd` initializes *user space* components that run after the Linux kernel has booted, as well as continuously maintaining those components throughout a system's lifecycle. These tasks are known as *units*, and each unit has a corresponding *unit file*. Units might concern mounting storage devices (.mount), configuring hardware (.device), sockets (.socket), or, as will be covered in this guide, managing services (.service).

### Starting and Stopping a Service

To start a `systemd` service in the current session, issue the `start` command:

    sudo systemctl start apache2.service

Conversely, to stop a `systemd` service, issue the `stop` command:

    sudo systemctl stop apache2.service

In the above example we started and then stopped the Apache service. It is important to note that `systemctl` does not require the `.service` extension when working with service units. The following is just as acceptable:

    sudo systemctl start apache2

If the service needs to be restarted, such as to reload a configuration file, you can issue the `restart` command:

    sudo systemctl restart apache2

Similarly, if a service does not need to restart to reload it's configuration, you can issue the `reload` command:

    sudo systemctl reload apache2

Finally, you can use the `reload-or-restart` command if you are unsure about whether your application needs to be restarted or just reloaded.

    sudo systemctl reload-or-restart apache2

### Enabling a Service at Boot

The above commands are good for managing a service in a single session, but many services are also required to start at boot. To enable a service at boot:

    sudo systemctl enable nginx

To disable the service from starting at boot, issue the `disable` command:

    sudo systemctl disable nginx

{{< note >}}
The `enable` command does not start the service in the current session, nor does `disable` stop the service in the current session. To enable/disable and start/stop a service simultaneously, combine the command with the `--now` switch:

    sudo systemctl enable nginx --now
{{</ note >}}

If the service unit file is not located within one of the known `systemd` file paths, you can provide a file path to the service unit file you wish to enable:

    sudo systemctl enable /path/to/myservice.service

However, this file needs to be accessible by `systemd` at startup. For example, this means files underneath `/home` or `/var` are not allowed, unless those directories are located on the root file system.

### Checking a Service's Status

`systemctl` allows us to check on the status of individual services:

    systemctl status mysql

This will result in a message similar to the output below:

{{< output >}}
    ● mysql.service - MySQL Community Server
      Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
      Active: active (running) since Thu 2018-08-30 09:15:35 EDT; 1 day 5h ago
    Main PID: 711 (mysqld)
        Tasks: 31 (limit: 2319)
      CGroup: /system.slice/mysql.service
              └─711 /usr/sbin/mysqld --daemonize --pid-file=/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
{{</ output >}}

You can also use `is-active`, `is-enabled`, and `is-failed` to monitor a service's status:

    systemctl is-enabled mysql

To view which `systemd` service units are currently active on your system, issue the following `list-units` command and filter by the service type:

    systemctl list-units --type=service

{{< note >}}
`list-units` is the default action for the `systemctl` command, so you can simply enter `systemctl` to retrieve a list of units.
{{</ note >}}

The generated list includes all currently active service units, service units that have jobs pending, and service units that were active and have failed:

    UNIT                            LOAD   ACTIVE SUB       DESCRIPTION
    accounts-daemon.service         loaded active running   Accounts Service
    apparmor.service                loaded active exited    AppArmor initialization
    apport.service                  loaded active exited    LSB: automatic crash report generation
    atd.service                     loaded active running   Deferred execution scheduler
    blk-availability.service        loaded active exited    Availability of block devices
    console-setup.service           loaded active exited    Set console font and keymap
    cron.service                    loaded active running   Regular background program processing daemon
    dbus.service                    loaded active running   D-Bus System Message Bus
    ebtables.service                loaded active exited    ebtables ruleset management
    ...

The output provides five pieces of data:

- **UNIT**: The name of the unit.
- **LOAD**: Was the unit properly loaded?
- **ACTIVE**: The general activation state, i.e. a generalization of SUB.
- **SUB**: The low-level unit activation state, with values dependent on unit type.
- **DESCRIPTION**: The unit's description.

To list all units, including inactive units, append the `--all` flag:

    systemctl list-units --type=service --all

You can filter the list of units by state. Supply a comma-separated list of unit states to output as the value for the `--state` flag:

    systemctl list-units --type=service --all --state=exited,inactive

To retrieve a list of failed units, enter the `list-units` command with the `--failed` flag:

    systemctl list-units --failed

## Working with Unit Files

Each unit has a corresponding *unit file*. These unit files are usually located in the following directories:

- The `/lib/systemd/system` directory holds unit files that are provided by the system or are supplied by installed packages.
- The `/etc/systemd/system` directory stores unit files that are user-provided.

### Listing Installed Unit Files

 Not all unit files are active on a system at any given time. To view all `systemd` service unit files installed on a system, use the `list-unit-files` command with the optional `--type` flag:

    systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

The generated list has two columns, **UNIT FILE** and **STATE**:

    UNIT FILE                              STATE
    accounts-daemon.service                enabled
    acpid.service                          disabled
    apparmor.service                       enabled
    apport-forward@.service                static
    apt-daily-upgrade.service              static
    apt-daily.service                      static
    ...

A unit's STATE can be either enabled, disabled, static, masked, or generated. Unit files with a static state do not contain an *Install* section and are either meant to be run once or they are a dependency of another unit file and should not be run alone. For more on masking, see [Masking a Unit File](#masking-a-unit-file).

### Viewing a Unit File

To view the contents of a unit file, run the `cat` command:

    systemctl cat cron

{{< output >}}
# /lib/systemd/system/cron.service
[Unit]
Description=Regular background program processing daemon
Documentation=man:cron(8)

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/cron
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/cron -f $EXTRA_OPTS
IgnoreSIGPIPE=false
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
{{</ output >}}

If there are recent changes to the unit file that have not yet been loaded into systemd, the output of the `systemctl cat` command may be an older version of the service.

For a low-level view of a unit file, issue the `show` command:

    systemctl show cron

This will generate a list of property key=value pairs for all non-empty properties defined in the unit file:

    Type=simple
    Restart=no
    NotifyAccess=none
    RestartUSec=100ms
    TimeoutStartUSec=1min 30s
    TimeoutStopUSec=1min 30s
    RuntimeMaxUSec=infinity
    ...

To show empty property values, supply the `--all` flag.

To filter the key=value pairs by property, use the `-p` flag:

    systemctl show cron -p Names

Note that the property name must be capitalized.

### Viewing a Unit File's Dependencies

To display a list of a unit file's dependencies, use the `list-dependencies` command:

    systemctl list-dependencies cron

The generated output will show a tree of unit dependencies that must run before the service in question runs.

    cron.service
    ● ├─system.slice
    ● └─sysinit.target
    ●   ├─apparmor.service
    ●   ├─blk-availability.service
    ●   ├─dev-hugepages.mount
    ●   ├─dev-mqueue.mount
    ●   ├─friendly-recovery.service
    ...

Recursive dependencies are only listed for `.target` files. To list all recursive dependencies, pass in the `--all` flag.

To check which unit files depend on a service unit file, you can run the `list-dependencies` command with the `--reverse` flag:

    systemctl list-dependencies cron --reverse

### Editing a Unit File

{{< note >}}
While the particulars of unit file contents are beyond the scope of this article, there are a number of good resources online that describe them, such as the RedHat Customer Portal page on [Creating and Modifying systemd Unit Files](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/sect-managing_services_with_systemd-unit_files).
{{</ note >}}

There are two ways to edit a unit file using `systemctl`.

1.  The `edit` command opens up a blank drop-in snippet file in the system's default text editor:

        sudo systemctl edit ssh

    When the file is saved, `systemctl` will create a file called `override.conf` under a directory at `/etc/systemd/system/yourservice.service.d`, where `yourservice` is the name of the service you chose to edit. This command is useful for changing a few properties of the unit file.

2.  The second way is to use the `edit` command with the `--full` flag:

        sudo systemctl edit ssh --full

    This command opens a full copy of whatever unit file you chose to edit in a text editor. When the file is saved, `systemctl` will create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/yourservice.service`. This is useful if you need to make many changes to an existing unit file.

In general, any unit file in `/etc/systemd/system` will override the corresponding file in `/lib/systemd/system`.

### Creating a Unit File

While `systemctl` will throw an error if you try to open a unit file that does not exist, you can force `systemctl` to create a new unit file using the `--force` flag:

    sudo systemctl edit yourservice.service --force

When the file is saved, `systemctl` will create an `override.conf` file in the `/etc/systemd/system/yourservice.service.d` directory, where 'yourservice' is the name of the service you chose to create. To create a full unit file instead of just a snippet, use `--force` in tandem with `--full`:

    sudo systemctl edit yourservice.service --force --full

### Masking a Unit File

To prevent a service from ever starting, either manually or automatically, use the `mask` command to symlink a service to `/dev/null`:

    sudo systemctl mask mysql

Similar to disabling a service, the `mask` command will not prevent a service from continuing to run. To mask a service and stop the service at the same time, use the `--now` switch:

    sudo systemctl mask mysql --now

To unmask a service, use the `unmask` command:

    sudo systemctl unmask mysql

### Removing a Unit File

To remove a unit file snippet that was created with the `edit` command, remove the directory `yourservice.service.d` (where 'yourservice' is the service you would like to delete), and the `override.conf` file inside of the directory:

    sudo rm -r /etc/systemd/system/yourservice.service.d

To remove a full unit file, run the following command:

    sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/yourservice.service

After you issue these commands, reload the `systemd` daemon so that it no longer tries to reference the deleted service:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

## Working with systemd Targets

Like other init system's run levels, `systemd`'s targets help it determine which unit files are necessary to produce a certain system state. `systemd` targets are represented by *target units*. Target units end with the `.target` file extension and their only purpose is to group together other systemd units through a chain of dependencies.

For instance, there is a `graphical.target` that denotes when the system's graphical session is ready. Units that are required to start in order to achieve the necessary state have `WantedBy=` or `RequiredBy=` `graphical.target` in their configuration. Units that depend on `graphical.target` can include `Wants=`, `Requires=`, or `After=` in their configuration to make themselves available at the correct time.

A target can have a corresponding directory whose name has the syntax `target_name.target.wants` (e.g. `graphical.target.wants`), located in `/etc/systemd/system`. When a symlink to a service file is added to this directory, that service becomes a dependency of the target.

When you enable a service (using `systemctl enable`), symlinks to the service are created inside the `.target.wants` directory for each target listed in that service's `WantedBy=` configuration. This is actually how the `WantedBy=` option is implemented.

### Getting and Setting the Default Target

To get the default target for your system --the end goal of the chain of dependencies-- issue the `get-default` command:

    systemctl get-default

If you would like to change the default target for your system, issue the `set-default` command:

    sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target

### Listing Targets

To retrieve a list of available targets, use the `list-unit-files` command and filter by target:

    systemctl list-unit-files --type=target

To list all currently active targets, use the `list-units` command and filter by target:

    systemctl list-units --type=target

### Changing the Active Target

To change the current active target, issue the `isolate` command. This command starts the isolated target with all dependent units and shuts down all others. For instance, if you wanted to move to a multi-user command line interface and stop the graphical shell, use the following command:

    sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target

However, it is a good idea to first check on the dependencies of the target you wish to isolate so you do not stop anything important. To do this, issue the `list-dependencies` command:

    systemctl list-dependencies multi-user.target

### Rescue Mode

When a situation arises where you are unable to proceed with a normal boot, you can place your system in rescue mode. Rescue mode provides a single-user interface used to repair your system. To place your system in rescue mode, enter the following command:

    sudo systemctl rescue

This command is similar to `systemctl isolate rescue`, but will also issue a notice to all other users that the system is entering rescue mode. To prevent this message from being sent, apply the `--no-wall` flag:

    sudo systemctl rescue --no-wall

### Emergency Mode

Emergency mode offers the user the most minimal environment possible to salvage a system in need of repair, and is useful if the system cannot enter rescue mode. For a full explanation of emergency mode, refer to the [RedHat Customer Portal page](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/sect-managing_services_with_systemd-targets#sect-Managing_Services_with_systemd-Targets-Emergency). To enter emergency mode, enter the following command:

    sudo systemctl emergency

This command is similar to `systemctl isolate emergency`, but will also issue a notice to all other users that the system is entering emergency mode. To prevent this message, apply the `--no-wall` flag:

    sudo systemctl emergency --no-wall

### More Shortcuts

`systemctl` allows users the ability to halt, shutdown and reboot a system.

To halt a system, issue the following command:

    sudo systemctl halt

To shutdown a system, use:

    sudo systemctl shutdown

Finally, to reboot a system, enter the following command:

    sudo systemctl reboot

Similar to the `emergency` and `rescue` commands, these commands will issue a notice to all users that the system state is changing.
