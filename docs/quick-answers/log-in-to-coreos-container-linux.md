title: Log in to CoreOS Container Linux
---

The `root` user is not active by default in Container Linux, so root login is not available. Instead, log in as the `core` user.

## Log in to CoreOS Over SSH

![Log in as core user SSH](/docs/assets/container-linux-login-ssh.png)

1.  From your local terminal, enter:

        ssh core@<your_linode's_IP>

2.  At the `password:` prompt, enter the `core` user's password you assigned when first having deployed Container Linux.

## Log in to CoreOS Through the Console (Lish or Glish)

![Log in as core user Lish](/docs/assets/container-linux-login-lish.png)

1.  At the `login:` prompt, enter `core`.

2.  At the `password:` prompt, enter the `core` user's password you assigned when first having deployed Container Linux.
