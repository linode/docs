Linode's [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) and [API](https://developers.linode.com) allow you to create tags to help organize and group your Linode resources. Tags can be applied to Linodes, [Block Storage Volumes](/docs/platform/block-storage/how-to-use-block-storage-with-your-linode-new-manager/), [NodeBalancers](/docs/platform/nodebalancer/getting-started-with-nodebalancers-new-manager/), and [Domains](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager-new-manager/).

This guide will show you how to perform the following actions with the Cloud Manager:

-   Create and apply tags to your Linode resources
-   Search and group your Linode resources by tag
-   Import tags from the Classic Manager

## Tagging an LKE Cluster

### Tag an LKE Cluster at Creation

1. Navigate to the **Kubernetes** section of the Linode Cloud Manager and [create your LKE cluster](/docs/kubernetes/deploy-and-manage-a-cluster-with-linode-kubernetes-engine-a-tutorial/#create-an-lke-cluster).

1. After the cluster is created, your cluster's summary page will appear. Click on the **Add a tag** link to begin adding tags to your cluster.

      ![Click on the Add Tags link to begin adding tags](add-tags-lke.png)

1. You can create a new tag and assign it to your cluster by typing the tag into the text entry box and clicking on the **Create my-new-tag** entry that appears.

      ![Create a new tag and add it to your LKE cluster](create-new-tag-lke.png)

    If you'd like to use an existing tag, select it from the dropdown list that appears.

      ![Select and existing tag and add it to your LKE cluster](select-existing-tag-lke.png)

    When your tag has been added to your cluster, you will see it appear on your cluster's summary page.

      ![Select and existing tag and add it to your LKE cluster](view-clusters-tags-lke.png)

### Tag an Existing LKE Cluster

1. Navigate to the **Kubernetes** section of the Linode Cloud Manager and select the cluster you'd like to add a tag to.

1. Viewing your cluster's summary page, click on the **Add a tag** link to begin adding tags to your cluster.

    ![Click on the Add Tags link to begin adding tags](add-tags-lke.png)

1. You can create a new tag and assign it to your cluster by typing the tag into the text entry box and clicking on the **Create my-new-tag** entry that appears.

    ![Create a new tag and add it to your LKE cluster](create-new-tag-lke.png)

    If you'd like to use an existing tag, select it from the dropdown list that appears.

      ![Select and existing tag and add it to your LKE cluster](select-existing-tag-lke.png)

    When your tag has been added to your cluster, you will see it appear on your cluster's summary page.

      ![Your tag has been successfully added to your cluster](view-clusters-tags-lke.png)

### Remove a Tag from an LKE Cluster

1. Navigate to the **Kubernetes** section of the Linode Cloud Manager and select the cluster from which you'd like to remove a tag.

1. Viewing the cluster's summary page, you will see a list of all of your cluster's tags. To remove a tag, click on the **x** next to the tag you'd like to remove.

      ![Remove an existing LKE cluster's tag.](remove-tag-lke.png)

## Grouping by Tag

You can group the following resources by tag: Linodes, Volumes, NodeBalancers, and Domains.

1. To group by tag, navigate to the resource's page and toggle the **Group by Tag** switch at the top of the page:

    ![Cloud Manager Group by Tag switch](tags-group-linodes.png "To group Linodes by tag, toggle the 'Group by Tag' box at the top of the Linodes page")

1. You will now be able to view your resources grouped by tag:

    ![Group your Linodes by tag](group-linode-tags.png "View all your grouped by tags Linodes")

## Searching by Tag

You can search your Linode resources by a tag's name:

1.  Type the tag name into the search bar at the top of the Cloud Manager and the results will be populated in a dropdown list that appears:

    ![Cloud Manager tag search](tags-search-bar.png "Search for resources by tag")

1.  To see a more organized view of your tagged resources, click on the blue **View search results page** banner inside the dropdown list, or hit the **Enter** key on your keyboard. You will be taken to the search results page:

    ![Cloud Manager search results page](tags-search-results.png "The search results page")

1.  A second way to search by tag is to click on a tag wherever it appears in the Cloud Manager. For example, if you previously applied a tag named `tag-example` to one of your Linodes, clicking on that tag where it is displayed in the Linode's detail page will take you to the search results page for `tag-example`.

## Importing Groups as Tags

If you have used the Display Groups feature in the Classic Manager, you can import your Display Groups to the Cloud Manager as tags:

1.  Navigate to the **Account** page in the sidebar links menu, then click on the **Settings** tab.

1.  Expand the panel labeled **Import Display Groups as Tags** and then click **Import Display Groups**:

    ![Cloud Manager import display groups as tags](tags-import-groups.png "Import display groups from the Classic Manager with the 'Import Display Groups' button in Account Settings")

1.  A form will appear that lists your Display Groups and asks you to confirm the import action. To proceed, click the **Import Display Groups Now** button in this form.

    {{< note >}}
Importing your Display Groups is a **one-time** operation. If you don't have any Display Groups configured in the Classic Manager this feature will not appear in the Cloud Manager.
