This QuickAnswer will show you how to deploy a Linux distribution to your Linode. See our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started-classic-manager/) and [Disks and Configuration Profiles](/docs/platform/disk-images/disk-images-and-configuration-profiles-classic-manager/) guides for additional information.

1.  Once you've created your Linode, select it from the **Linodes** tab to access the Dashboard. Click on **Deploy an Image**:

    The *Deploy* page will open:

2.  Select a Linux distribution from the **Image** menu.

3.  Enter a size for the disk in the **Deployment Disk Size** field. By default, all of the available space on your Linode is allocated. Note that the minimum deployment size for you distribution is listed under the disk size field - in this example the minimum is **900MB** for a Debian 8 image.

4.  Select a swap disk size from the **Swap Disk** menu. Unless you have a specific reason to use more, the default **256MB** is recommended.

5. Enter a root password for your Linode in the **Root Password** field. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH; it must be at least 6 characters long and contain at least two of the following:

    -   lowercase and uppercase case letters
    -   numbers
    -   punctuation marks

6.  Click **Deploy**. You can monitor the progress of your distribution deployment from the Linode's job queue. Once it completes, click the **Boot** button to boot your Linode.
