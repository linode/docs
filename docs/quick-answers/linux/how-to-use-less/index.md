## What is Less?

On Linux systems, `less` is a command that displays file contents or command output one page at a time in your terminal. `less` is most useful for viewing the content of large files or the results of commands that produce many lines of output. The content displayed by `less` can be navigated by entering keyboard shortcuts.

## Invoking Less

To view the content of a file with `less`:

    less your-file-name

To view the output of another command with `less`, redirect the output from that command using a [pipe](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html):

    ps -ef | less

To see line numbers on each line, use the `-N` option:

    less -N your-file-name

## Keyboard Navigation in Less

Use the following key commands to navigate through content viewed by `less`:
