## What is a Distribution?

**Distributions** or *"distros"* can be described as different operating system versions built on top of the underlying Linux Kernel to support a variety of use-cases and preferences. Since all distributions are built on Linux, most are similar and can be used interchangeably. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), for example, is the most popular for it's ease of use and the ability to abstract smaller configuration tasks for you by default. [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) on the other hand does not provide this simplicity in favor of more control, so that you can fine tune the way that your system
functions.

Below is a full list of distributions that we provide, and a brief description of each:

| Distribution | Description |
|------|-------|
| [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/) | Lightweight distribution popular with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and security minded users. |
| [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) | Powerful and detail oriented, empowers more advanced users to fine tune their configuration. |
[CentOS](https://www.centos.org) | Widely popular in professional and business settings while still being accessible to the average user. |
[CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) |  Container-focused distribution, designed for clustered deployments |
[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) | One of the oldest distributions in use, popular, steady, and reliable. Regularly updated and maintained. |
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) | Implements bleeding edge software. Fedora is similar though more advanced than CentOS and great for users who want to use the newest of the new and don't mind an added layer of complexity.  |
[Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) | Advanced distribution designed for power users who want more control over their configuration and are comfortable compiling everything from source. |
[Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) | The oldest actively maintained distribution. One of the most UNIX-like Linux distributions available. |
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) | Arguably the most popular Linux distribution, widely regarded for it's ease of use. |
[OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) | Provides powerful tools specific to system administration tasks. |

{{< note >}}
Though this list covers most popular distributions, creating a Linode using a distribution that we do not provide is possible. Feel free to follow our [Custom Distribution Guide](/docs/tools-reference/custom-kernels-distros/install-a-custom-distribution-on-a-linode/) for more information.
