## What is fsck?

fsck, short for file system consistency check, is a utility that examines the file system for errors and attempts to repair them if possible. It uses a combination of built-in tools to check the disk and generates a report of its findings.

On some systems, fsck runs automatically after an unclean shutdown or after a certain number of reboots.

## When to Use fsck

Use fsck to check your file system if your system fails to boot, if files on a specific disk become corrupt, or if an attached drive does not act as expected.
Unmount the disks you intend to work on before attempting to check or repair them.

{{< caution >}}
Unmount the target disk first. You risk corrupting your file system and losing data if you run fsck on an active disk.
{{< /caution >}}

## fsck Options and Arguments

| Option | Action |
| ------:|:------------------ |
| `-a`   | Attempt to fix errors automatically. Use with caution. |
| `-f`   | Force fsck to check a file system even if it thinks it's clean.  |
| `-A`   | Check all disks listed in `/etc/fstab`.  |
| `-C`   | Show progress bar (ext2 and ext3 file systems only).  |
| `-M`   | Skip mounted file systems.  |
| `-N`   | Test run. Describes what would happen without executing the check itself. |
| `-P`   | Use with the `-A` option to run multiple checks in parallel.  |
| `-R`   | If using the `-A` option, do not check the root filesystem.  |
| `-t`   | Check only a specific type of filesystem.  |
| `-T`   | Skip the title on startup.  |
| `-y`   | Interactive repair mode.  |

## Unmount the Disk

### Boot into Rescue Mode

If you are using fsck on a Linode, the easiest and safest way to unmount your disk is to use Rescue Mode. Visit our [Rescue and Rebuild](/docs/troubleshooting/rescue-and-rebuild/#booting-into-rescue-mode) guide for instructions on how to boot your Linode into Rescue Mode. If you're working on a local machine, consider using the distribution's recovery mode or a live distribution to avoid working on a mounted disk. fsck should be run only as a user with root permissions.

### View Mounted Disks and Verify Disk Location

1.  Run `df` to view a list of currently mounted disks. If you are using Rescue Mode, the disk you want to check should not be listed:

        df -h

2.  Use `fdisk` to view disk locations:

        fdisk -l

    Copy the location of the target disk to use with the fsck command.

### Configuration Profile

If you are working on a Linode but do not wish to use Rescue Mode, shut down the Linode from the Linode Manager. Unmount the disk from the [Configuration Profile](/docs/platform/disk-images/disk-images-and-configuration-profiles/#editing-a-configuration-profile). Apply the changes and reboot the Linode.

### Manual Unmount

If you are working on a local machine, unmount the disk manually.

1.  Use `umount` to unmount the disk location copied in the [previous step](#view-mounted-disks-and-verify-disk-location):

        umount /dev/sdb

2.  If the disk is declared in `/etc/fstab`, change the `mount point` to `none` there as well.

## How to Check for Errors on a Disk

Run fsck on the target disk, using the desired options. This example checks all file systems (`-A`) on `/dev/sdb`:

    fsck -A /dev/sdb

### Understand fsck Error Codes

The error codes that fsck returns can be understood with the following table from [man7.org](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fsck.8.html):

| Code | Error Code Meaning |
| ----:|:------------------ |
|   0 | No errors  |
|   1 | Filesystem errors corrected  |
|   2 | System should be rebooted  |
|   4 | Filesystem errors left uncorrected  |
|   8 | Operational error  |
|  16 | Usage or syntax error  |
|  32 | Checking canceled by user request  |
| 128 | Shared-library error  |

## Use fsck to Repair File System Errors

Use the `-r` option to use the interactive repair option.

This example uses fsck to check all file systems except the root, and will attempt repair using the interactive feature:

    fsck -AR -y

To check and attempt to repair any errors on `/dev/sdb`, use this format:

    fsck -y /dev/sdb

## What if fsck got interrupted?

If fsck gets interrupted, it will complete any checks in process, but will not attempt to repair any errors it finds.
