Git is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) that can be used to manage software projects. This guide's six steps will show you how to initialize a Git repository, stage files for a commit, and commit these files to a local Git repository. For fuller instruction, refer to our more robust guide on [Git Source Control Management](/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-mac-and-windows/).

1.  Create a folder in which to store your files, then initialize a Git repository in that folder:

		mkdir testgit
		cd testgit
		git init

2. Create files for Git to track, then append some text to a file:

		touch file.txt file2.txt file3.txt
		echo "hello Linode" >> file.txt

3.  Use command, `git status`, to return information about the current Git repository:

		git status
		On branch master

		Initial commit

		Untracked files:
		 (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

		file.txt
		file2.txt
		file3.txt

		nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

4. Since `file.txt`contains text, you want Git to track any future changes to that file. Use `git add file.txt` to add `file.txt` to the list of files Git monitors. Type `git status` after the addition to confirm that Git is tracking the new file.

		git add file.txt
		git status

	This will return:

		On branch master

		Initial commit

		Changes to be committed:
		(use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

		new file:   file.txt

		Untracked files:
			(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

			file2.txt
			file3.txt

5. To commit the changes of `file.txt` to the version control system, use `git commit`. Git requires you to write a commit message, a message will help you remember the changes you have made to your files. In this example, use the `-am` options to commit `a`ll modified files, specifically the ones Git is tracking, and include a commit message:

		git commit -am "Added Hello Linode to file.txt"

    Git will return the following message, confirming your new changes:

		[master (root-commit) e8cc496] added new file
		1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
		create mode 100644 file.txt

6. Track the remaining files in the directory using `git add -A`, and commit them with a message:

		git add -A
		git status

    Returns:

		On branch master
		Changes to be committed:
		(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

		modified:   file.txt
		new file:   file2.txt
		new file:   file3.txt

    Now, commit the changes:

        git commit -am "The end!"

        [master 52a9240] The End
        4 files changed, 1 insertion(+)
        create mode 100644 file1.txt
        create mode 100644 file2.txt
        create mode 100644 file3.txt

{{< note >}}
`git add -A`, `git add .`, and `git add -u` can all be used to stage files for a commit.
 `git add -A` stages `a`ll of the files in the directory. `git add .` stages only the new and modified files, omitting  any deleted files. `git add -u` stages only the modified and deleted files, omitting any new files.
