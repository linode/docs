### Security Enhanced Linux

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security module developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and Red Hat. With SELinux, an  administrator can enforce a set of policies for the system users. These policies can provide a virtual sandbox in which applications can run. SELinux is like a firewall for applications; its policies function as a set of rules to filter system access.

At times, SELinux can disupt the functionality of a recently installed app, and therefore, may need to be disabled. This Quick Answer guides you through the steps necessary to shut it down (but not uninstall). 

{: .note}
>
>This guide requires an unconfined root account. You will only be able to disable SELinux if you have the highest level of permissions on your machine. 

### Disable SELinux

{: .caution}
> Disabling SELinux removes a security feature on your system, and doing so may expose your data.
> If you are considering disabling SELinux to fix an application on your system, consider fixing the application to work within SELinux, instead.

However, in certain instances it might be easier to disable SELinux than it is to write policies that support SELinux in your environment. Uninstalling SELinux is not recommended. 

To disable SELinux on your Linode:

1. Navigate to the SELinux configuration directory at `/etc/sysconfig/selinux`:

        cd /etc/sysconfig/selinux
        cat /etc/sysconfig/selinux

    {:.file-excerpt}
    /etc/sysconfig/selinux
    : ~~~ config
      # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
      # SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
      #     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
      #     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
      #     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
      SELINUX=enabled
      # SELINUXTYPE= can take one of three two values:
      #     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
      #     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
      #     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
      SELINUXTYPE=targeted
      ~~~

2. Change `SELINUX=enabled` to `SELINUX=disabled`:

    {:.file-excerpt}
    /etc/sysconfig/selinux
    : ~~~selinux
      # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
      # SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
      #     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
      #     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
      #     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
      SELINUX=disabled
      # SELINUXTYPE= can take one of three two values:
      #     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
      #     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
      #     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
      SELINUXTYPE=targeted
      ~~~

3. `reboot` your system and run `sestatus`:

		root@host: sestatus
		SELinux status:                 disabled
