Fish, the Friendly Interactive Shell, is a replacement shell, which, out of the box, offers auto-suggestions; programmable completions based on installed man pages; a fully functional, readable, scripting language; and colored text support.


## Install Fish

Install Fish using your distro's package manager:

	apt install fish

Start the Fish shell with the `fish` command:

	root@localhost:~# fish
	Welcome to fish, the friendly interactive shell

### Customize Fish

The configuration file for Fish is located at: `~/.config/fish/config.fish`. You can write commands or Fish functions to this file. The `fish_config` command, will load a customization server on the browser, ![fish_config](/docs/assets/fish/fish_config.png).


## Regarding Fish

Fish is similar to other shells: you type commands followed by arguments.

	root@localhost ~# adduser Linode
	Adding user `Linode' ...
	Adding new group `Linode' (1001) ...
	Adding new user `Linode' (1001) with group `Linode' ...
	Creating home directory `/home/Linode' ...

However, in Fish, you chain commands with `;`, instead of `&&`:

	root@localhost ~# mkdir FishDocs && cd FishDocs
	Unsupported use of '&&'. In fish, please use 'COMMAND; and COMMAND'.
	fish: mkdir FishDocs && cd FishDocs
	                      ^

If you can't function without `!!` and `&&`, check [this](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/wiki/Bash-Refugees) repo out for a solution.


## Use Fish

Fish boasts a full-featured scripting language. You can use scripts written in Fish to do anything you would do with a scripting language, and even some cooler [things](https://github.com/onodera-punpun/neet), like managing your anime/drama series.


### Functions
Fish does not support aliasing. Instead Fish uses `functions`. Typing `functions` into Fish will output a list of functions that exist by default:


	root@localhost ~/.c/fish# functions
	., N_, abbr, alias, cd, contains_seq, delete-or-exit, dirh, dirs,
	down-or-search, eval, export, fish_config, fish_default_key_bindings,
	fish_indent, fish_mode_prompt, fish_prompt, fish_sigtrap_handler,
	fish_update_completions, fish_vi_cursor, fish_vi_key_bindings, fish_vi_mode,
	funced, funcsave, grep, help, history, hostname, isatty, la, ll, ls, man, math,
	mimedb, nextd, nextd-or-forward-word, open, popd, prevd, prevd-or-backward-word,
	prompt_pwd, psub, pushd, seq, setenv, sgrep, trap, type, umask, up-or-search,
	vared,

You can begin writing your own functions by using the syntax: `functions name`

You can write for loops on the fly with Fish:

You can learn more about Fish scripting in the official [tutorial](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html).


If you are a long time bash user, you may have accumulated an abundance of bash scripts, one-liners, and configurations that might make you reluctant to change shells. Fish-script is written differently than other scripting languages, but the built in `bash -c` command will run bash scripts from the Fish command line without hesitation.

For example, if you have a script that prints numbers 1-10:

	for ((k=1; k<=10; ++k)); do echo $k; done
	Expected keyword 'in', but instead found end of the statement
	fish: for ((k=1; k<=10; ++k)); do echo $k; done
	                             ^

Using `bash -c`, you can take that same script as a string and run it without exiting Fish.

## Next Steps

The best way to learn Fish is to use it. Fish is designed with **The Law Of Discoverability** in mind:

	A program should be designed to make its features as easy as possible to discover for the user.
	Rationale: A program whose features are discoverable turns a new user into an expert in a shorter span of time,
	since the user will become an expert on the program simply by using it.
