GNU nano, or more commonly, nano is the basic, built-in editor for most Linux distributions. In this QuickAnswer, we'll cover some of the essentials to help you get started.

To learn more, visit our full guide on [using nano](/docs/tools-reference/tools/use-nano-text-editor-commands/).

## Use nano to Open a System File

From the terminal, enter `nano` and the file name. If the file doesn't exist, nano will create a new, temporary version in the location you specify. In this example, we'll use `sudo` permissions to open the system's hosts file:

    sudo nano /etc/hosts

The above example opens the system hosts file, similar to the following:

![Ubuntu hosts file in nano](/docs/assets/nano-hosts-ubuntu.png "Ubuntu hosts file in nano")

In the default view, nano displays the file being edited in the center of the top *Titlebar*. At the bottom, the *Shortcut List* shows commonly used commands where `^` stands for the **CTRL** key. To save, hold **CTRL** and press **O** (for Write *O*ut); to exit, **CTRL+X**.

Notice that some commands induce the *Statusbar*, at the bottom, directly above the Shortcut List. For example, the Statusbar appears when saving files and running searches (**CTRL+W**).

## Helpful nano Shortcuts

* **^W**: Search within the open file
  * **ALT+W**: Find the next instance of the search
* **^O**: Save the file
* **^K**: Cut the entire line
  * **^U**: Paste the entire line
* **^T**: View the file browser
* **^X**: Exit
