### Controller

A Kubernetes Controller is a control loop that continuously watches the Kubernetes API and tries to manage the desired state of certain aspects of the cluster. Examples of different Controllers include:

-   ReplicaSets, which manage the number of running instances of a particular Pod.
-   Deployments, which manage the number of running instances of a particular Pod and can perform upgrades of Pods to new versions.
-   Jobs, which manage Pods that perform one-off tasks.
