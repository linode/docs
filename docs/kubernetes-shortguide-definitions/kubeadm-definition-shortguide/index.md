### kubeadm

[kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/) is a cloud provider-agnostic tool that automates many of the tasks required to get a cluster up and running. Users of kubeadm can run a few simple commands on individual servers to turn them into a Kubernetes cluster consisting of a master node and worker nodes.
