### ReplicaSet

A [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) is one of the Controllers responsible for keeping a given number of replica Pods running. If one Pod goes down in a ReplicaSet, another will be created to replace it. In this way, Kubernetes is self-healing. However, for most use cases it is recommended to use a Deployment instead of a ReplicaSet.
