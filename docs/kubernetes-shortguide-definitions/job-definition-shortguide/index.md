### Job

A [Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) is a Controller which manages Pods created for a single or a set of tasks. This is handy if you need to create a Pod that performs a single function, or calculates a value. The deletion of the Job will delete the Pod.
