### Dockerfile

A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) contains all commands, in their required order of execution, needed to build a given Docker image. For example, a Dockerfile might contain instructions for:

- Installing a specific operating system referencing another image,
- Installing an applicationâ€™s dependencies, and
- Executing configuration commands in the running container.
