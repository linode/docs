## Container Storage Interface

The [Container Storage Interface (CSI) specification](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) provides a common storage interface for container orchestrators like Kubernetes (and others, like Mesos). The interface is used by an orchestrator to attach storage volumes to containers and to manage the lifecycle of those volumes.

The objective of this specification is to allow cloud computing platforms to develop a single storage plugin that works with any container orchestrator. Linode has authored a [CSI driver](https://github.com/linode/linode-blockstorage-csi-driver) for Linode's Block Storage service, which makes Block Storage Volumes available to your containers.
