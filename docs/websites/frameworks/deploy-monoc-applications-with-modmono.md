The ASP.NET framework is an application development system, designed by Microsoft to run code written in a variety of languages within a managed runtime environment. Mono is an open source project that aims to provide an ASP.NET-compatible toolkit, including a C\# compiler a Common Language Runtime (CLR).

`mod_mono` is an Apache module that makes it possible to run ASP.NET applications in Linux environments running Apache. These guides do not outline any particular method of developing applications nor any of the popular tools for working in a Mono environment. Nevertheless, these documents but do include a basic test application to help you get started with ASP.NET/Mono application development and deployment on your Linux VPS.
