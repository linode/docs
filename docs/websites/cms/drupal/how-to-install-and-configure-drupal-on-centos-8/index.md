Drupal 8 is the latest version of the popular [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) content management system. This guide demonstrates how to install Drupal 8 on your Linode running CentOS 8.


## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for [setting your Linode's hostname](/docs/getting-started/#set-the-hostname) and [timezone](/docs/getting-started/#set-the-timezone).

1. Follow our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide to [create a standard user account](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#add-a-limited-user-account), [harden SSH access](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#harden-ssh-access), [remove unnecessary network services](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#remove-unused-network-facing-services) and [create firewall rules](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#configure-a-firewall) for your web server; you may need to make additional firewall exceptions for your specific application.

    {{< content "limited-user-note-shortguide" >}}

1.  Install and configure a [LAMP stack on CentOS 8](/docs/web-servers/lamp/how-to-install-a-lamp-stack-on-centos-8/)

1.  Install the `wget` and `tar` utilities. You will need this in a later section to install the Drupal 8 core.

        sudo yum install wget -y && sudo yum install tar

1. In order to work with Drupal 8 and SELinux, you will need to install Python's policy core utilities, which give you access to useful tools to manage SELinux settings.

        sudo yum install policycoreutils-python-utils

## Download and Prepare Drupal 8

1. Navigate to your site's document root. If you installed and configured your Apache server using our [LAMP stack on CentOS 8](/docs/web-servers/lamp/how-to-install-a-lamp-stack-on-centos-8/) guide, your document root should be located in the `/var/www/html/example.com/public_html/` directory. Replace `example.com` with your own document root path's name.

        cd /var/www/html/example.com

1. Download the Drupal 8 tarball. As of writing this guide, Drupal 8.8.2 is the latest version. See [Drupal's download page](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal) for their latest core tarball.

        sudo wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-8.8.2.tar.gz

    {{< caution >}}
Ensure that the version number matches the Drupal 8 version you wish to download.
{{< /caution >}}

1.  Extract the downloaded tarball's contents into your site's document root:

        sudo tar -zxvf drupal-8.*.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C public_html

1.  Drupal depends on a PHP graphics library called GD. Install GD and other dependencies:

        sudo yum install -y php php-{cli,mysqlnd,json,opcache,xml,mbstring,gd,curl}

1. Create your Drupal 8 installation's `settings.php` file from the default settings file. This file will be configured when you run through Drupal's web configuration in the [Drupal First Start](#drupal-first-start) section.

        sudo cp /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/sites/default/default.settings.php /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/sites/default/settings.php

1.  Enforce [trusted hostnames](https://www.drupal.org/node/2410395) with those that users will access your site from. With the text editor of your choice, edit your `settings.php` file replacing the [regular expression (RegEx)](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php) with a pattern that matches your own site's URL(s).

    {{< file "/var/www/html/example.com/public_html/sites/default/settings.php" conf >}}
$settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = array(
  '^www\.example\.com$',
  '^example\.com$',
  );

{{< /file >}}


    {{< note >}}
`trusted_host_patterns` also accepts IP addresses or localhost.
{{< /note >}}

## Configure Apache 2.4

1.  Enable Apache's [rewrite module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html). This module is necessary since Drupal 8 enables [Clean URLs](https://www.drupal.org/getting-started/clean-urls) by default. To enable this module, edit your Apache configuration to include the `LoadModule` line displayed in the example file below.

    {{< file "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf" apache >}}
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
    {{</ file >}}

2.  Specify the rewrite conditions for your Drupal site's document root in Apache's configuration file using the text editor of your choice. If you installed and configured your Apache server using [LAMP stack on CentOS 8](/docs/web-servers/lamp/how-to-install-a-lamp-stack-on-centos-8/) guide, the configuration file for your site is located at `/etc/httpd/conf.d/example.com.conf`.

    {{< file "/etc/httpd/sites-enabled/example.com.conf" conf >}}
<Directory /var/www/html/example.com/public_html>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteBase /
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
      RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]
</Directory>
{{< /file >}}

1. Set the SELinux context for the directories Drupal 8 and Apache in order to read and write to them. This includes your site's root directory and subdirectories.

        sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/html/example.com/public_html(/.*)?"
        sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t '/var/www/html/example.com/public_html/sites/default/settings.php'
        sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t '/var/www/html/example.com/public_html/sites/default/files'
        sudo restorecon -Rv /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
        sudo restorecon -v /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/sites/default/settings.php

1.  Change the ownership of your site's document root from `root` to `apache`. This allows you to install modules and themes, and to update Drupal, without being prompted for FTP credentials.

        sudo chown apache:apache -R /var/www/html/example.com/public_html

1.  Restart Apache so all your changes are applied.

        sudo systemctl restart httpd

## Drupal First Start

1.  Go to your Linode's domain or IP address in a web browser. This will show you the first step of Drupal 8's web configuration. Choose your language and proceed to the next page.

    ![Drupal 8 choose language.](drupal-choose-language.png)

2.  Choose whether you want a *Standard* or *Minimal* installation profile.

    ![Drupal 8 choose installation profile.](drupal-choose-installation-profile.png)

3.  Complete the database configuration using the DB name, username and password you created when [setting up your LAMP stack](/docs/web-servers/lamp/how-to-install-a-lamp-stack-on-centos-8/) with a MySQL or MariaDB database.

    ![Drupal 8 database configuration.](drupal-database-configuration.png)

    {{< note >}}
If you forgot the name of your database, log back in to MySQL or MariaDB with: `mysql -u root -p` and enter: `show databases;`.
{{< /note >}}

4.  After Drupal 8 installs your site, you'll be shown a site configuration page where you must create the admin user for your website. Do not use the same password that you used for your database.

    ![Drupal 8 site configuration.](drupal-site-configuration.png)

    Next, you'll be taken to the administrative dashboard which will say that Drupal 8 was installed successfully.

    ![Drupal 8 installed welcome.](drupal-installed-welcome.png)

5.  Now that Drupal 8 is finished writing to `settings.php` and `services.yaml`, you can restore their default permissions:

        sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/sites/default/{settings.php,services.yml}

## Where to Go From Here

Drupal has a significant amount of documentation for [security best practices](https://www.drupal.org/security/secure-configuration) to consider when hardening any Drupal server. There is also extensive [community documentation](https://www.drupal.org/documentation) and there are multiple ways of [participating in the Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org/community).
