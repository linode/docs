[Drush](https://www.drush.org/) is a command line tool for creating, administrating, and modifying Drupal websites. This tutorial uses Drush to install themes and modules. It will also briefly cover backups and migrations for Drupal websites.

## Before You Begin

Before installing themes, modules, and a backup system using Drush, make sure that the following prerequisites have been met:

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for [setting your Linode's hostname](/docs/getting-started/#set-the-hostname) and [timezone](/docs/getting-started/#set-the-timezone).

1. Follow our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide to [create a standard user account](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#add-a-limited-user-account), [harden SSH access](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#harden-ssh-access), [remove unnecessary network services](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#remove-unused-network-facing-services) and [create firewall rules](/docs/security/securing-your-server/#configure-a-firewall) for your web server; you may need to make additional firewall exceptions for your specific application.

1.  Install and configure a [LAMP stack on CentOS 8](/docs/web-servers/lamp/how-to-install-a-lamp-stack-on-centos-8)

1.  Install [Composer and Drush on CentOS 8](/docs/websites/cms/drupal/drush-drupal/how-to-install-drush-on-centos-8)

1.  Make sure that your system is up to date, using:

        sudo yum update

{{< note >}}
The Drush commands to download or enable themes and modules vary depending on the version of Drush that you have installed. This guide uses Drush 10.

## Installing Themes with Drush

In this section you will download, enable, and set a Drupal theme using Drush.

1. Navigate to [Drupal's Download and Extend page](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme) to find the theme you want to download. The Drush download name is usually appended to the end of the Drupal theme page's URL; for example, `drupal.org/project/project/my_theme`.

1. Move into your Drupal site's document root, `/var/www/html/example.com/public_html/`. Replace `example.com` with your own domain's name.

        cd /var/www/html/example.com/public_html

1.  Download your desired theme using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/). For example to download the `bootstrap` theme use:

         composer require drupal/bootstrap

    {{< note >}}
If you receive an error related to not being able to write to the `composer.json` file, see the [Setting the Siteâ€™s Ownership and Permissions](/docs/websites/cms/drupal/drush-drupal/how-to-install-drupal-using-drush-on-centos-8/#setting-the-site-s-ownership-and-permissions) section of the [Install Drupal using Drush on CentOS 8](/docs/websites/cms/drupal/drush-drupal/how-to-install-drupal-using-drush-on-centos-8/) guide.

Ensure that your `/var/www/html/example.com/public_html` directory has user and group read, write, and execute permissions.

    sudo chmod 774 -R /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
    {{</ note >}}

1.  Enable the theme that you downloaded in the previous step. For example, to enable the `bootstrap` theme run the following command. Replace `bootstrap` with the name of your theme.

        drush theme:enable bootstrap

1.  As an example, set the [Omega](https://www.drupal.org/project/omega) theme as the default and active theme:

        drush config-set system.theme default omega

    Check the homepage of your site and the new theme should appear.

## Installing Modules with Drush

Downloading and enabling a module is similar to working with a theme. However, modules can be used for almost any purpose. From enhancing public-facing functionality to providing a better administrative UI; there are thousands of Drupal modules. It is helpful to use modules with clear documentation, since once a module is installed, its interface can be challenging to use if it is not well documented and designed by the contributor.

1. Move into your Drupal site's document root, `/var/www/html/example.com/public_html/`. Replace `example.com` with your own domain's name.

        cd /var/www/html/example.com/public_html

1. Download the [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) module. This module enables you to perform the backup, restore, and migrate tasks

        composer require drupal/backup_migrate

2.  Enable the `backup_migrate` module:

        drush en backup_migrate -y

3.  Sign in to your Drupal site's browser interface and navigate to the **Extend** menu item (or **Administration > Extend**). Under the **OTHER** section, the Backup and Migrate module will be listed and selected.

You have successfully installed and enabled a new module. The module is now running and ready to be used.

## Backup a Drupal Site

It's always important to keep regular backups of a website. Backups protect you from losing data due to configuration changes, vulnerabilities, or system failures. Backups should be stored on a separate system whenever possible. The **Backup and Migrate** module helps you to create backups of your site.

1.  To configure backup and migrate, navigate to **Administration > Configuration > Development > Backup and Migrate**

2. For a quick backup, select the type of **Backup Source** and select the **Backup Destination**, and click **Backup now**

Always download a backup prior to updating or installing modules.
