![How to Install Ghost CMS on Ubuntu 16.04](/docs/assets/ghost/ghost-blog-ubuntu-16-04-title-graphic.png "How to Install Ghost CMS on Ubuntu 16.04")

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/developers/) is an open source blogging platform that helps you easily create a professional-looking online blog.

Ghost 1.0.0 is the first major, stable release of the Ghost content management system (CMS). Ghost 1.0.0 has a brand new Markdown editor, refreshed user interface, new default theme design, improved install and update process with [Ghost-CLI](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-CLI), and more.

In this guide you'll set up, deploy, and secure a Ghost 1.0.0 blog on a Linode running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, using nginx, MySQL, Node.js, NPM, Ghost-CLI, and Let's Encrypt.

>
>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you're not familiar with the `sudo` command, consult our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.
>
>Replace each instance of `example.com` in this guide with your site’s domain name.

## Before you Begin

1. This guide assumes that you've followed the steps in our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) and [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guides and have created a new user for Ghost with elevated `sudo` privileges. The example in this guide uses `ghostexample`.

2. Ensure that you have a valid domain name and properly configured DNS records for your domain.

3. Ensure that your system is up to date:

       sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

4. Install `build-essential`:

       sudo apt install build-essential

## Install nginx

nginx will be used as a reverse proxy for your Ghost application:

    sudo apt install nginx

## Install MySQL

1. Download and install MySQL:

       sudo apt install mysql-server

    Enter a strong password for the `root` user when prompted.

2. Run the `mysql_secure_installation` script:

       sudo mysql_secure_installation

## Install Node.js and NPM

Ghost is built on Node.js and follows Node's Long Term Support (LTS) plan. Ghost only supports [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS).

Download and install Node.js:

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt install nodejs

## Install Ghost-CLI

Ghost-CLI is a command line interface (CLI) tool that makes installing and updating Ghost easy. It sets up the database, configures nginx as a reverse proxy, enables TLS/SSL security using Let's Encrypt CA, automatically renews your SSL, and initializes Ghost as a systemd service.

1. Install Ghost-CLI:

       sudo npm install -g ghost-cli@latest

2. Troubleshoot the system for any potential issues when installing or updating Ghost:

       ghost doctor

3. Get help about `ghost`:

       ghost help

## Install Ghost

Install Ghost 1.0.0 using the Ghost-CLI tool.

1. Create the document root directory:

       sudo mkdir -p /var/www/ghost

2. Change ownership of the `/var/www/ghost` directory to the non-root user with `sudo` privileges that you created. In this example, `ghostexample`:

       sudo chown ghostexample:ghostexample /var/www/ghost

3. Navigate to the Ghost root directory:

       cd /var/www/ghost

4.  Ensure that the directory is empty to avoid file conflicts:

        ls -a

5. Install Ghost in production mode:

       ghost install

6. Answer each question as prompted. For more information about each question, visit the [Ghost documentation](https://docs.ghost.org/docs/cli-install#section-prompts):

       ? Enter your blog URL: https://example.com
       ? Enter your MySQL hostname: localhost
       ? Enter your MySQL username: root
       ? Enter your MySQL password: areallysecurepassword
       ? Enter your Ghost database name: exampleGhost
       ? Do you wish to set up Nginx? yes
       ? Do you wish to set up SSL? yes
       ? Enter your email (used for Let's Encrypt notifications) user@example.com
       ? Do you wish to set up "ghost" mysql user? yes
       ? Do you wish to set up Systemd? yes
       ? Do you want to start Ghost? yes

7. After installation is complete, run `ghost ls` to view running Ghost processes:

       ghost ls

In the future when a newer version of Ghost is released, run `ghost update` from the `/var/www/ghost` directory to update to the newest version.

## Complete the Setup

To complete the setup process, navigate to the Ghost configuration page by appending `/ghost` to the end of your blog’s URL or IP. This example uses `https://example.com/ghost`.

1. On the welcome screen, click **Create your account**:

2. Enter your email, create a user, password, and blog title:

    ![Create Your Account Screen](/docs/assets/ghost-1-0-0-create-account-small.png "Create Your Account Screen")

3. Invite additional members to your team. If you’d prefer to skip this step, click **I’ll do this later, take me to my blog!** at the bottom of the page.
