[Ghost](https://ghost.org/developers/) is an open source blogging platform that helps you easily create a professional-looking online blog. Ghost is a robust content management system (CMS) with a Markdown editor, an easy-to-use user interface, and beautiful themes. It is easy to install and update with [Ghost-CLI](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-CLI).

## In This Guide

In this guide, you'll set up, deploy, and secure a Ghost v3.5.1 blog on a Linode running CentOS 8, using NGINX, MariaDB, Node.js, NPM, and Ghost-CLI. For installation instructions for other distributions, click [here](/docs/websites/cms/ghost).

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you're not familiar with the `sudo` command, consult our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

Replace each instance of `example.com` in this guide with your site’s domain name.
{{< /note >}}

## Before you Begin

1. This guide assumes that you've followed the steps in our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) and [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guides and have created a new user for Ghost with elevated `sudo` privileges. The example username used in this guide is `ghostexample`.

1. Ensure that you have a valid domain name and [properly configured DNS records](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/) for your domain.

1. Ensure that your system is up to date:

        sudo yum update

1.  Set your system to SELinux permissive mode:

        sudo setenforce 0
        sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config

1. Add `EPEL repository`:

        sudo dnf -y install epel-release

## Install Prerequisites

### Install and Configure MariaDB

1. Download and install MariaDB:

        sudo dnf module install mariadb

1.  Set MySQL to start on reboot:

        sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb

1.  Secure the MySQL installation:

        mysql_secure_installation

You will be given the choice to change the MariaDB root password, remove anonymous user accounts, disable root logins outside of localhost, and remove test databases. It is recommended that you answer `yes` to these options. You can read more about the script in the [MariaDB Knowledge Base](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mysql_secure_installation/).

### Install Node.js and NPM

Ghost is built on Node.js and follows Node's Long Term Support (LTS) plan. Ghost only supports [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS).

Download and install Node.js:

    sudo dnf -y install @nodejs
    sudo npm install pm2 -g

### Install and Configure NGINX

NGINX will be used as a reverse proxy for your Ghost application:

1.  Install NGINX:

        sudo dnf install @nginx

1.  Navigate to the `/etc/nginx/`  directory which will contain your configuration files:

        cd /etc/nginx/

1.  Create new directories for your Ghost configuration files:

        sudo mkdir sites-available
        sudo mkdir sites-enabled

1.  Create a configuration file for Ghost at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost`, replace `example.com` with your site's domain:

    {{< file "/etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost" >}}
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    server_name example.com www.example.com;
    root /var/www/ghost;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2368;
    }

    client_max_body_size 50m;
}
{{</ file >}}

1.  Create a symlink from `sites-available` to `sites-enabled`:

        sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ghost

1.  Update the `http` block in your NGINX config `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file by adding an include for the configuration file you just made, a directive for `server_names_hash_bucket_size`, and comment out the entire `server` block:

    {{< file "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf" >}}
http {
...
    # Load modular configuration files from the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory.
    # See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#include
    # for more information.
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;

# server {
#    listen  80 default_server {
#        ...
#    }
#}
...
{{</ file >}}

1.  Open the firewall for traffic:

        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=http
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=https
        sudo firewall-cmd --reload

1.  You can test your NGINX configuration with this command:

        sudo nginx -t

1.  Start the service with the following commands:

        sudo systemctl enable nginx
        sudo systemctl start nginx

1.  Verify that it's running:

        sudo systemctl status nginx

## Install and Configure Ghost

### Install Ghost-CLI

Ghost-CLI is a command line interface (CLI) tool that makes installing and updating Ghost easy. For CentOS, it will set up the database and initialize Ghost as a systemd service.

Install Ghost-CLI:

    sudo npm install -g ghost-cli@latest

### Install Ghost

Install Ghost using the Ghost-CLI tool.

1. Create the document root directory:

        sudo mkdir -p /var/www/ghost

    {{< note >}}
Installing Ghost in the `/root` or `/home/{user}` folder won’t work and results in a broken setup. Only use `/var/www/{folder}` because it has the correct permissions.
{{</ note >}}

1. Change ownership of the `/var/www/ghost` directory to the non-root user with `sudo` privileges that you created. In this example, `ghostexample` is our username:

        sudo chown ghostexample:ghostexample /var/www/ghost
        sudo chmod 775 /var/www/ghost

1. Navigate to the Ghost root directory:

        cd /var/www/ghost

1.  Ensure that the directory is empty to avoid file conflicts:

        ls -a

1. Install Ghost in production mode:

        ghost install

    {{< note >}}
By default Ghost looks for Ubuntu and will display this warning if it detects a different operating system.

{{< output >}}
System checks failed with message: 'Linux version is not Ubuntu 16 or 18'
Some features of Ghost-CLI may not work without additional configuration.
For local installs we recommend using `ghost install local` instead.
{{</ output >}}

It will ask you if you would like to continue anyway, answer yes.

The installer also gets a little confused at our installing MariaDB instead of MySQL. It appears to error with a note that it is skipping MySQL and asks if you want to continue anyway, answer yes.
{{</ note >}}

1. Answer each question as prompted. For more information about each question, visit the [Ghost documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/#install-questions):

{{< /output >}}

1. After installation is complete, run `ghost ls` to view running Ghost processes:

        ghost ls

In the future when a newer version of Ghost is released, run `ghost update` from the `/var/www/ghost` directory to update to the newest version.

### Complete the Setup

To complete the setup process, navigate to the Ghost configuration page by appending `/ghost` to the end of your blog’s URL or IP. This example uses `https://example.com/ghost`.

1. On the welcome screen, click **Create your account**:

    ![Ghost Welcome Screen](ghost-welcome-screen.png "Ghost Welcome Screen")

1. Enter your email, create a user, password, and blog title:

    ![Create Your Account Screen](ghost-create-your-account.png "Create Your Account Screen")

1. Invite additional members to your team. If you’d prefer to skip this step, click **I’ll do this later, take me to my blog!** at the bottom of the page.

    ![Invite Your Team Screen](ghost-1-0-0-invite-team-small.png "Invite Your Team Screen")

1. Navigate the Ghost admin area to create your first post, change your site's theme, or configure additional settings:
