[DirectAdmin](http://directadmin.com) is a commercial web-based control panel for server systems. It can help ease the burden of common system administration tasks such as website creation, database deployment and management, and more. This article will show you how to create a reseller account on DirectAdmin.

# Create a Reseller Package

Before you can create a reseller account on your DirectAdmin Linode, you'll need to set up a package for resellers through your admin login. The first thing you need to do is log into your DirectAdmin panel with your admin user. Then, click on the "Manage Reseller Packages" link under the Server Management section. You'll then need to click the "Add Package" link near the top of the page. You'll want to fill in the form with the limits you wish to impose on the reseller plan you are creating. An example of the completed form is shown here:

# Create a Reseller Account

Once you have your reseller package created, you can move onto creating your reseller's account. Click the Home icon at the top of the page, then the "Create Reseller" link in the Server Management section. You'll want to fill in the form presented with your reseller client's information:

Make sure you use a valid email address as the DirectAdminsystem will email your reseller their account details! That email will look similar to this:

    Dear Customer,

# Create a User Package

You can create user accounts either through the admin login or any reseller login. If you are logged into the DirectAdmin panel with your Admin login, just click the "Â» Reseller Level" link located on the top right of the panel. You'll need to create a package for your user accounts, so you'll want to first click the "Add Package" link under the Account Management section. You'll want to fill in the form with the limits you wish to impose on the user account plan you are creating. An example of the completed form is shown here:

Once you have your user package created, you can move onto creating your user's account. Click the Home icon at the top of the page, then the "Add New User" link in the Server Management section. You'll want to fill in the form presented with your reseller client's information:
