[AskBot](https://askbot.com) is an open source question and answer forum written in Django web framework and Python. It provides rich features similarly like StackOverflow including Karma based system, voting, question and answer workflow, e-mail updates, content moderation, etc. It is used by most popular opensource community like Ask-Fedoraproject, Ask-Openstack and others. In this guide, you'll install and configure AskBot after that, you'll secure it using LetsEncrypt SSL certificates to deploy it on your Ubuntu 16.04 Linode.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do **not** follow the Configure a Firewall section yet--this guide includes firewall rules specifically for an OpenVPN server.

3.  Update your system:
    	
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

4.  A Fully-Qualified Domain Name configured to point to your Linode. You can learn how to point domain names to Linode by following the How to [Add DNS records with Linode](/docs/networking/dns/dns-manager-overview#add-records) guide.

{: .note}
> This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.
 
## Installing Required Packages for AskBot

1.  First Install the required packages including Nginx, MySQL, Python PIP, etc.

	sudo apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev nginx mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev letsencrypt

## Create Database for AskBot

1.  Log in to MySQL as the root user:
        
	sudo mysql -u root -p

2.  When prompted, enter the root password.

3.  Create a New MySQL User and Database. In below, `askbotdb` is the name of the database, `dbuser` is the database user, and `dbpassword` is the database user’s password.

        CREATE DATABASE askbotdb CHARACTER SET UTF8;
	CREATE USER dbuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'dbpassword';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON askbotdb.* TO dbuser@localhost;
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	
4.  Exit MySQL.

        exit

## Install AskBot

{: .note}
> In this guide `example_user` is [non-root user with sudo privileges](/docs/security/securing-your-server#ubuntu). You should replace `example_user` with your desired username.

1.  Create a Directory to install the AskBot. In below, `/home/example_user/askbot` is the location of AskBot installation directory.

	mkdir -p /home/example_user/askbot

2.  In below we are using the pip to install the python packages now upgrade the **pip** to latest version. 

	sudo pip install --upgrade pip

3.  Now setup the isolated Python virtual environment by installing the **virtualenv** using pip.

	sudo pip install virtualenv

4.  Create a Python virtual environment using **virtualenv** command. In below, `/home/example_user/askbot/askbotenv` is the location of Python virtual environment.
	
	virtualenv /home/example_user/askbot/askbotenv

5.  After that Activate the Python virtual environment using **source** command. In below, `/home/example_user/askbot/askbotenv/bin/activate` is the location of source file it is used to activate the Python virtual environment

	source /home/example_user/askbot/askbotenv/bin/activate

6.  To install Askbot and its dependencies like mysqlclient, mysql-python and gunicorn the **pip** is the best tool. 

	pip install askbot mysqlclient mysql-python gunicorn

## Configure Askbot 

1.  Initialize the AskBot setup files by typing command **askbot-setup** . After that In below, **-n** `/home/example_user/askbot/` is the installation location of AskBot, **-e** `3` is the MySQL database type, **-d** `askbotdb` is the name of database, **-u** `dbuser` is the database user, and **-p** `dbpassword` is the database password.

	askbot-setup -n /home/example_user/askbot/ -e 3 -d askbotdb -u dbuser -p dbpassword

2.  After that run command collectstatic to place all the static files like (css,js,etc) into AskBot installation directory. In below `/home/example_user/askbot/manage.py` is the location of **manage.py** file.

	python /home/example_user/askbot/manage.py collectstatic --noinput

3.  When you install Askbot the first time and any time you upgrade the Askbot, you should run these two commands. In below `/home/example_user/askbot/manage.py` is the location of **manage.py** file.

	python /home/example_user/askbot/manage.py makemigrations
	python /home/example_user/askbot/manage.py migrate

4.  Now Turn off the Debug settings to use AskBot in production environment. In below `/home/example_user/askbot/settings.py` is the location of **settings.py** file.

	sed -i "s|DEBUG = True|DEBUG = False|" /home/example_user/askbot/settings.py

5.  After that change the URL of static files (css,js,etc) from `/m/` to `/static/`. In below `/home/example_user/askbot/settings.py` is the location of **settings.py** file.

	sed -i "s|STATIC_URL = '/m/'|STATIC_URL = '/static/'|" /home/example_user/askbot/settings.py

## Deploy Askbot with Letsencrypt SSL

1.  We passed Gunicorn a module by specifying the relative directory path to **wsgi.py** file, which is used to communicate with the Askbot application. In below `/home/example_user/askbot/wsgi.py` is the location of **wsgi.py** file.

	nano /home/example_user/askbot/wsgi.py 

Add the given lines

{: .file-excerpt}
/home/example_user/askbot/wsgi.py
:   ~~~ conf
import os
os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "settings")
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
~~~

Press **CTRL+O** to write then hit **ENTER** to save the file then **CTRL+X** to exit the program.

2.  Gunicorn can interact with our Askbot application, but we should implement starting and stopping it. To do this, we'll make a Systemd service file. In below `/home/example_user/askbot` is the working directory of AskBot, `/home/example_user/askbot/askbotenv/bin/gunicorn` is the location of Gunicorn application, `unix:askbot.sock` is the askbot sock file.

	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service

Add the given lines

{: .file-excerpt}
/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
:   ~~~ conf
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
User=example_user
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/example_user/askbot
Environment="PATH=/home/example_user/askbot/askbotenv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/example_user/askbot/askbotenv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:askbot.sock wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~

Press **CTRL+O** to write then hit **ENTER** to save the file then **CTRL+X** to exit the program.

3.  Now start the Gunicorn service and enable it so that it starts automatically at every boot:

	sudo systemctl start gunicorn
	sudo systemctl enable gunicorn

4.  After that restart the nginx and reload the daemon

	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl restart nginx

5.  Now get the [Letsencrypt SSL](/docs/security/ssl/install-lets-encrypt-to-create-ssl-certificates) for your Domain . In below, `admin@example.com` is your email address and `example.com` is your domain name and `www.example.com` is your sub-domain name.

{: .note}
>You should point your Fully-Qualified Domain Name to your Linode this is the required step to get Letsencrypt SSL certificates for your domain name. You can learn how to point domain names to Linode by following the How to [Add DNS records with Linode](/docs/networking/dns/dns-manager-overview#add-records) guide.

	sudo letsencrypt certonly -a webroot --agree-tos --email admin@example.com --webroot-path=/var/www/html -d example.com -d www.example.com

6.  Now Remove the default Nginx Server Blocks (Virtual Host) and Nginix index file

	sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

7.  Add the Nginx server Blocks (Virtual Host) to run AskBot in Production Environment. In below, `example.com` is your domain name and `www.example.com` is your sub-domain name, `/home/example_user/askbot` is the working directory of AskBot, `unix:/home/example_user/askbot/askbot.sock` is the location of askbot sock file.

	sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/askbot 

Add the given lines

{: .file-excerpt}
/etc/nginx/sites-available/askbot
:   ~~~ conf
server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com www.example.com;
        return    301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
        listen 443;
        server_name example.com www.example.com;
        
	ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        
	location ~ /.well-known {
        allow all;
        root /var/www/html;
        }

        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
        location /static/ {
        root /home/example_user/askbot;
        }
	
        location /upfiles/ {
        root /home/example_user/askbot/askbot;
        }

		
        location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/example_user/askbot/askbot.sock;
        }
}
~~~

Press **CTRL+O** to write then hit **ENTER** to save the file then **CTRL+X** to exit the program.

8.  Add symbolic link between nginx server blocks

	sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/askbot /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

9.  Add the www-data user to your group with the following command. In below replace `example_user` with your desired username: 

	sudo usermod -aG www-data example_user
	
10.  Finally restart nginx to make changes in effect

	sudo systemctl restart nginx
