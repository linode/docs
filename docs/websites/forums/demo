[AskBot](https://askbot.com) is an open source question and answer forum written in Django web framework and Python. It provides rich features similarly like StackOverflow including Karma based forum system, voting, question and answer workflow, e-mail updates, content moderation, etc. It is used by most popular opensource community like Ask-Fedoraproject, Ask-Openstack and others. In this guide, you'll install and configure AskBot after that, you'll secure it using LetsEncrypt SSL certificates to deploy it on your Ubuntu 16.04 Linode.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do **not** follow the Configure a Firewall section yet--this guide includes firewall rules specifically for an OpenVPN server.

3.  Update your system:
    	
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

4.  A Fully-Qualified Domain Name configured to point to your Linode. You can learn how to point domain names to Linode by following the How to [Add DNS records with Linode](/docs/networking/dns/dns-manager-overview#add-records) guide.

{: .note}
> This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.
 
## Installing Required Packages

1.  First Install the required packages including Nginx, MySQL, Python PIP, etc.

	sudo apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev nginx mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev letsencrypt

## Using MySQL

1.  Log in to MySQL as the root user:
        
	sudo mysql -u root -p

2.  When prompted, enter the root password.

### Create a New MySQL User and Database

1.  In below, `askbotdb` is the name of the database, `askbotdbuser` is the database user, and `askbotdbpassword` is the database user’s password.

        CREATE DATABASE askbotdb CHARACTER SET UTF8;
	CREATE USER askbotdbuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'askbotdbpassword';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON askbotdb.* TO askbotdbuser@localhost;
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	
2.  Exit MySQL.

        exit

### Restart MySQL service

1.  Now Restart MySQL service to make changes in effect:

	sudo systemctl restart mysql

## Install AskBot

1.  Create a Directory to install the AskBot. In below, `/var/www/html` is the location of AskBot installation directory.

	sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html

2.  Upgrade the **pip** to latest version 

	sudo pip install --upgrade pip

3.  Setup isolated Python virtual environment by installing the **virtualenv** using pip.

	sudo pip install virtualenv

4.  Create a Python virtual environment using **virtualenv** command. In below, `/var/www/html/askbotenv` is the location of Python virtual environment.
	
	sudo virtualenv /var/www/html/askbotenv

5.  Now Activate the Python virtual environment using **source** command 

	source /var/www/html/askbotenv/bin/activate

6.  To install Askbot and its dependencies **pip** is the best tool. 

	sudo pip install askbot mysqlclient mysql-python gunicorn

## Configure Askbot 

1.  Initialize the AskBot setup files by typing command **askbot-setup** . After that In below, **-n** `/var/www/html/` is the installation location of AskBot, **-e** `3` is the MySQL database type, **-d** `askbotdb` is the name of database, **-u** `askbotdbuser` is the database user, and **-p** `askbotdbpassword` is the database user’s password.

	sudo askbot-setup -n /var/www/html/ -e 3 -d askbotdb -u askbotdbuser -p askbotdbpassword

2.  After that run command collectstatic to place all the static files like (css,js,etc) into AskBot installation directory. In below `/var/www/html/manage.py` is the location of **manage.py** file.

	sudo python /var/www/html/manage.py collectstatic --noinput

3.  When you install Askbot the first time and any time you upgrade the Askbot, you should run these two commands. In below `/var/www/html/manage.py` is the location of **manage.py** file.

	sudo python /var/www/html/manage.py makemigrations
	sudo python /var/www/html/manage.py migrate

4.  Now Turn off the Debug settings to use AskBot in production environment. In below `/var/www/html/settings.py` is the location of **settings.py** file.

	sudo sed -i "s|DEBUG = True|DEBUG = False|" /var/www/html/settings.py

5.  After that change the static files (css,js,etc) URL from `/m/` to `/static/`. In below `/var/www/html/settings.py` is the location of **settings.py** file.

	sudo sed -i "s|STATIC_URL = '/m/'|STATIC_URL = '/static/'|" /var/www/html/settings.py

## Deploy Askbot 

sudo nano /var/www/html/wsgi.py 

import os
os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "settings")
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()

chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html 

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
