TWiki is a robust "structured wiki" roughly comparable to other "Enterprise" wiki solutions such as [Confluence](/docs/websites/wikis/confluence-on-debian-5-lenny). Structured wikis provide a powerful way to share, store, and work with information in task centric applications. TWiki is a foundation for supporting content-centric workflows including bug and issue tracking, knowledge management, and data entry. Written in Perl and distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL, TWiki is highly extensible and has a robust and active plug-in infrastructure. Because of this flexibility, TWiki straddles the boundary between web application and web application framework. These guides outline a basic TWiki installation, setup, and configuration process.
