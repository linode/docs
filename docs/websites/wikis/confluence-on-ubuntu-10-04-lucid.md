[Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) is a popular wiki system that features easy editing and publishing, Microsoft Office and SharePoint integration, the ability to add custom features via plugins, and more. It is [free for use](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/licensing.jsp#nonprofit) by official non-profit organizations, charities, educational institutions, and established open source projects. These guides will help you get started with Confluence on your Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) Linode. It is assumed that you're starting with a freshly deployed system. If you've already deployed applications to your Linode, you may need to make some adjustments to these instructions to accommodate your existing setup. It is also assumed that you've already obtained a license key for Confluece; if not, please do so before proceeding. These steps should be performed as the "root" user via an SSH session.

Set the Hostname
----------------

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Install Confluence
------------------

Issue the following commands to update your package repositories, install all available application updates, and add the Ubuntu partner repository. The partner repository is required to allow the installation of the Sun Java 6 JDK; alternate Java JDK packages (such as OpenJDK) are not supported by Confluence as of this writing.

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded
    apt-get install python-software-properties
    add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner"
    apt-get update

Issue the following command to install prerequisite packages.

    apt-get install sun-java6-jdk libice-dev libsm-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxp-dev libxt-dev libxtst-dev

When prompted, review the Sun Java 6 license.

[![Sun Java 6 JDK license.](/docs/assets/317-sun-jdk-install-01.png)](/docs/assets/317-sun-jdk-install-01.png)

Accept the license to proceed with installation.

[![Accepting the Sun Java 6 JDK license.](/docs/assets/318-sun-jdk-install-02.png)](/docs/assets/318-sun-jdk-install-02.png)

Create a user account and directories for Confluence by issuing the following commands. Be sure to set a strong password to the `confluence` user.

    groupadd confluence
    useradd confluence -g confluence -d /var/lib/confluence
    passwd confluence
    mkdir /var/lib/confluence
    chown confluence:confluence /var/lib/confluence
    mkdir /usr/local/confluence
    chown confluence:confluence /usr/local/confluence

Visit the [Confluence download page](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/ConfluenceDownloadCenter.jspa) to obtain a link to the latest version to the software for Linux. Issue the following commands to download and unpack the software archive, adjusting the `wget` command as necessary to reflect the correct link.

    su - confluence
    cd /usr/local/confluence
    wget http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/downloads/binary/confluence-3.3.1-std.tar.gz
    tar -xvf confluence*gz

Edit the `confluence-init.properties` file, adding the following line to it. Adjust the full path to the file as necessary to reflect the current version number.

{: .file-excerpt }
/usr/local/confluence/confluence-3.3.1-std/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/confluence-init.properties
: ~~~
  confluence.home=/var/lib/confluence
  ~~~

Edit the `setenv.sh` file, adding the following lines. Adjust the full path to the file as necessary to reflect the current version number.

{: .file-excerpt }
/usr/local/confluence/confluence-3.3.1-std/bin/setenv.sh
:  ~~~
   JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun"
   export JAVA_HOME
   ~~~

Issue the following command to return to a root shell.

    exit

Issue the following commands to create an init script to control the Confluence application, mark this file executable, and configure Confluence to start automatically when the system boots:

    cd /opt/
    wget -O init-deb.sh http://www.linode.com/docs/assets/616-init-deb.sh
    mv init-deb.sh /etc/init.d/confluence
    chmod +x /etc/init.d/confluence
    update-rc.d confluence defaults

Confluence should now be installed. Next, you'll create a database to store information related to your Confluence installation.

Create the Confluence Database
------------------------------

Issue the following commands to install PostgreSQL and some useful "contrib" components.

    apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
    su - postgres
    psql template1 < /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/adminpack.sql
    exit

You should see output similar to the following:

    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION

Issue the following command to set a password for the `postgres` system user. While not strictly required, it can be useful for cases where you want to do things like establish an SSH tunnel to the `postgres` account for remote administration.

    passwd postgres

Issue the following commands to set a password for the `postgres` administrative user. Be sure to replace "changeme" with a strong password. This password will be used to connect to the database via the network; ident authentication will be used for local connections made with psql while logged into a shell as the postgres user.

    su - postgres
    psql -d template1 -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'changeme';"

Issue the following command to create a `confluence` PostgreSQL role, making sure to assign a strong password.

    createuser confluence --pwprompt

Use the following values when asked about various settings.

    Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
    Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
    Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n

Create the Confluence database by issuing the following commands.

    exit
    su - confluence
    createdb confluence
    exit

PostgreSQL should now be properly configured. Next, you'll create a virtual host for your Confluence site.

Create a Virtual Host for Confluence
------------------------------------

By default, the web interface for Confluence runs on port 8080. If you're comfortable with instructing your users to use this port, you may skip this section. Otherwise, follow these instructions to use the Apache web server to host a traditional virtual host for your Confluence installation.

Issue the following commands to install Apache and enable proxy modules.

    apt-get install apache2
    a2enmod proxy
    a2enmod proxy_http

Edit the `/etc/apache2/mods-available/proxy.conf` file to match the following example.

{: .file }
/etc/apache2/mods-available/proxy.conf
:   ~~~ apache
    <IfModule mod_proxy.c>
            #turning ProxyRequests on and allowing proxying from all may allow
            #spammers to use your proxy to send email.

            ProxyRequests Off

            <Proxy *>
                    AddDefaultCharset off
                    Order deny,allow
                    Allow from all
            </Proxy>

            # Enable/disable the handling of HTTP/1.1 "Via:" headers.
            # ("Full" adds the server version; "Block" removes all outgoing Via: headers)
            # Set to one of: Off | On | Full | Block

            ProxyVia On
    </IfModule>
    ~~~

Create a virtual host configuration file for your Confluence site. Use the following example, editing the filename and contents as necessary to reflect your actual domain name and public IP address. Please note that you will need to add an "A" record to your DNS configuration to point the site to your Linode's public IP address. This example assumes that Confluence will be running on its default port (8080).

{: .file }
/etc/apache2/sites-available/confluence.example.com
:   ~~~ apache
    <VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerAdmin support@example.com
         ServerName confluence.example.com
         ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
         ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
    </VirtualHost>
    ~~~

Issue the following commands to enable the site, restart Apache, and start Confluence.

    a2ensite confluence.example.com
    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
    /etc/init.d/confluence start

Apache should now be properly configured. Next, you'll configure Confluence.

Configure Confluence
--------------------

If you created a virtual host for your Confluence installation, direct your browser to `http://confluence.example.com`, replacing "confluence.example.com" with the site you set up with Apache. Otherwise, visit the URL `http://12.34.56.78:8080`, replacing "12.34.56.78" with your Linode's public IP address. Enter your license key on the first screen and click the "Production Installation" button to continue.
