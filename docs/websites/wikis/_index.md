description: "Wikis are collaboratively edited websites modeled after Ward Cunningham's [WikiWikiWeb](http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb), also known as the [c2 wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki). By design, the 'wiki concept' destabilizes the relationship between 'reader' and 'editor' around which conventional media and websites revolve. These guides will help you set up a wiki site to allow your community to maintain interlinked web pages."
