Lighttpd (pronounced "lighty") is a high performance web server package, designed to power the delivery of web content to small and large sites alike. With enhanced support for implementing scalabe FastCGI web applications, this web server has enjoyed increasing popularity with organizations focused on delivering dynamic content with less overhead than traditionally deployed solutions like Apache.
