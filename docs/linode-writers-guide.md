![Linode Writer's Guide](/docs/assets/linode-writers-guide.png "Linode Writer's Guide")

Linode has a thriving community of authors who contribute to Linode Guides and Tutorials. We are always looking for qualified technical writers who can create guides associated with those topics we list (and update) on our [Contribute](/docs/contribute) page, and/or update popular existing guides. 

If you're interested in writing for Linode, the [Contribute](/docs/contribute) page describes the process for submitting your work. If your guide is accepted and then published, you'll receive up to $300 per article by check, wire, or in Linode credit.

## Content Guidelines

Guides should instruct readers how to accomplish a task on, or relating to, a Linode or Linodes. When writing, think of both *what* the guide should accomplish and *why* the reader would want to use your guide. A guide should consist of about 90% instruction with 10% explanation.

A succinct, two or three sentence overview of your topic should begin the guide.

Guides should be informational but friendly. Use the active voice whenever possible, and the pronouns *you* or (to a much lesser extent) *we* instead of *I*. Avoid unnecessary information. Brief, to-the-point explanations are preferred, but also consider the audience and the level of technical ability needed to complete each task. A beginner's topic usually will require more detailed explanations than one for an advanced user.

Accepted submissions will be written in English and must adhere to the formatting described in our [Writer's Formatting Guide](/docs/linode-writers-formatting-guide). The primary qualities we look for in a guide are:

*   **Accuracy:** Instructions should be straightforward, technically correct and thoroughly tested. Include brief explanations of each step to explain the purpose of each action. Guides can use technical jargon pertinent to Linode, Linux, and related topics, but use common sense--if a term implies an advanced concept that fewer people would know, take a sentence or two to explain it, or link to a wiki or manual page.

*   **Completeness:** A guide should leave readers with a finished, working configuration and give them an idea of where to go from there. Considerations for security and best practices must also be made, including firewall rules.

*   **Originality:** Content should be original material written for Linode. We will not accept submissions which are duplicated from other sources, including personal blogs.

If you would like to see whether your work is in line with our requirements before taking the time to write a full guide, writing samples can be submitted to <contribute@linode.com>.

## The Submission Process

All writers interested in writing a guide for our library must FIRST complete the form on our [Contribute](/docs/contribute) page. Once our editors have reviewed your application, we will let you know whether or not to proceed with your guide proposal. 

If your submission is accepted, please submit your article as a pull request to [Linode/Docs](https://github.com/linode/docs/) on GitHub. If you are new to GitHub, see our [GitHub Beginners Guide](/docs/github-guide), which will walk you through the process.

For the foreseeable future, we will no longer accept unsolicited guides sent to <contribute@linode.com>. However, if you have difficulty using GitHub, you can submit the approved guide by email (in .docx, Google Doc, or plain text format). Please be sure to include the **guide title** in the subject line.

If you have any questions about submissions, let us know at <contribute@linode.com>. We will reply.

## The Review Process

If accepted, we will do an internal technical review of your material, which can take from a few days to about a week. Following the technical review, we perform a copy edit, which will take a few days more. During the editing  process, you may receive questions or comments from us, pull requests with edits, or a request for a resubmission with changes.

Depending on your submission method, we will either submit the final version to your GitHub fork as a pull request or email it to you. You will have 36 hours to respond and approve the final version. If you respond positively, we will publish the article and you'll receive payment. Non-response will be taken as your implied consent to publish.


### General Tips to Consider

*   Topics chosen MUST come from the list on our [Contribute](/docs/contribute) page. These topics are relevant, current and in-demand. We reserve the right to consider guides on emerging tech that has not been well documented or is not on this list. But please, discuss with us first. Remember, unsolicited guides will NOT be accepted.

*   Use other Linode guides as building blocks.	For example, if your guide requires a system with a working LAMP stack, you can link to our [LAMP guides](/docs/websites/lamp) instead of duplicating that information in your own writing.

*   Link to your guide from your own website or social media posts. This actually improves the page rankings of your own site because of an SEO aspect called *link authority*.

*   Avoid 3rd-party PPAs and repositories.

*   Unless there is a major advantage, use distro repositories rather than compiling and installing from source code.

*   Use proper capitalization for software. For example, nginx is the web server, NGINX Inc. is the company behind it, and Nginx would only be used to start a sentence, title or heading.

### Reasons Your Guide May Be Rejected

As much as we would like to support all writers and their favored topics, we can't. We don't have the bandwidth to review them all, nor does a small and partial audience for an esoteric, arcane topic justify allocating those resources. If your submission has been declined, the following could be reasons why:

*   Not enough content, or lacking original content. For example, if the guide too closely resembles a current guide either by Linode or from another source.

*   Guide is a duplicate of your own content from your personal blog, wiki submissions or forum posts.

*   Topic is sufficiently documented in official wikis, manual pages, etc.

*   [Content](#content-guidelines) and [formatting](/docs/linode-writers-formatting-guide/) guidelines were clearly not followed.

*   We already have plenty of guides on the topic. Examples: LAMP & LEMP stacks, MySQL.

*   Inappropriate topic for the Linode Community.
