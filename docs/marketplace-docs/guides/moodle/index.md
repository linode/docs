### Obtain the Credentials

Once the app is deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

To obtain the credentials:

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console**: Log in to Cloud Manager, click the **Linodes** link in the left menu, and select the Compute Instance you just deployed. Click **Launch LISH Console**. Log in as the `root` user. To learn more, see [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH**: Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. To learn how, see [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/).

1.  Run the following command to access the credentials file:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

This returns passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Save them. Once saved, you can safely delete the file.

## Getting Started After Deployment

### Access Your Moodle App

To access your Moodle instance, Open a browser and navigate to your Linode rDNS domain `https://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com`. Replace `https://203-0-113-0.ip.linodeusercontent.com` with your [Linode's RDNS domain](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/#viewing-ip-addresses).

From there, you can login by clicking the box on the top right of the page. Once you see the login page, you can enter the admin username entered at deployment as the *username* and the *password* that can be obtained in the credentials file.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your dashboard, checkout [the official Moodle documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Main_page) to learn how to further configure your instance.
