A MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack is a free and open-source web software bundle used to build modern web applications:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document database used to persist your application's data.

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) serves as the web application framework.

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) is used to build your application's user interfaces using JavaScript. Angular offers Web Workers and server-side rendering that helps your applications achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) serves as the run-time environment for your application.

MEAN is a full-stack JavaScript-based framework consisting of MongoDB database, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS. You can build entire web applications on JavaScript, from client to server to database with this stack. Single-language programming makes it easier to develop working applications more quickly without sacrificing functionality and features.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** The MEAN stack should be fully installed within 2-5 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Recommended minimum plan:** 1GB Shared Compute Instance or higher, depending on the number of sites and size of the sites you plan on hosting.

### MEAN Options

- **Email address** *(required)*: Enter the email address to use for generating the SSL certificates.

## Getting Started After Deployment

Once the app is deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

To obtain credentials:

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console**: Log in to Cloud Manager, click the **Linodes** link in the left menu, and select the Compute Instance you just deployed. Click **Launch LISH Console**. Log in as the `root` user. To learn more, see [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH**: Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. To learn how, see [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/).

1.  Run the following command to access the credentials file:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

This returns passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Save them. Once saved, you can safely delete the file.

Once deployed, a *Hello World* sample application should be running. The Express backend runs on port `5000`, and Nginx serves the Angular frontend through your custom domain or rDNS domain over ports `80` and `443`. Follow the instructions below to view or access it.

### Accessing the MEAN App through the Command Line

The MEAN stack components are organized as follows:
- Frontend (Angular): `/var/www/[domain]`
- Backend (Express): `/var/www/[domain]/backend`

To access these components within the command line:

1.  Log in to your Compute Instance via [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).

1.  Go to the backend directory:

        cd /var/www/[domain]/backend

1.  To view the Express server file, run:

        cat server.js

1.  To view the Angular frontend files, run:

        cd /var/www/[domain]
        ls

### Viewing the MEAN App through a Web Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to `https://[domain]`, where `[domain]` is the custom domain you entered during deployment or your Compute Instance's rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing rDNS.

## Software Included

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MongoDB 8.0** | Document-based database |
| **Express** | Web application framework |
| **Angular** | JavaScript frontend framework with CLI |
| **Node.js 22.x** | Runtime environment |
| **NGINX** | Web server |
| **UFW (UncomplicatedFirewall)** | Firewall utility. Ports 22, 80, and 443 for IPv4 and IPv6 are set to allow traffic. All other ports have the following firewall rules: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing). |
