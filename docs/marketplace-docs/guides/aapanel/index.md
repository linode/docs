[aaPanel](https://www.aapanel.com/) is a free and open source web hosting control panel. It lets you manage the server's web server, websites, databases, FTP, and more through a simple web-based interface. Through aaPanel, you can quickly install a LEMP (NGINX) or LAMP (Apache) stack on your server and start hosting your websites.

### Obtain the Credentials

Once the app is deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

To obtain the credentials:

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console**: Log in to Cloud Manager, click the **Linodes** link in the left menu, and select the Compute Instance you just deployed. Click **Launch LISH Console**. Log in as the `root` user. To learn more, see [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH**: Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. To learn how, see [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/).

1.  Run the following command to access the credentials file:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

This returns passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Save them. Once saved, you can safely delete the file.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your aaPanel App

1.  Log in to your instance through [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/). Once you've login via SSH you will see the message of the day (MOTD) which includes the login URL for this instance.

2.  Open the URL and enter the login credentials.

1. Choose which One-Click services (LAMP/LNMP) you want to install.
