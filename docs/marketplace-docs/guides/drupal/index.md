[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is a content management system (CMS) designed for building custom websites for personal and business use. Built for high performance and scalability, Drupal provides the necessary tools to create rich, interactive "community" websites with forums, user blogs, and private messaging. Drupal also has support for personal publishing projects and can power podcasts, blogs, and knowledge-based systems, all within a single, unified platform.

In addition to the core infrastructure, there are a number of freely available Drupal modules that allow administrators of Drupal sites to provide additional functionality, and a robust API makes it easy to enable these features. Furthermore, Drupal has an advanced theming engine that allows for a great amount of flexibility for displaying content.

### Obtain the Credentials

Once the app is deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

To obtain the credentials:

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console**: Log in to Cloud Manager, click the **Linodes** link in the left menu, and select the Compute Instance you just deployed. Click **Launch LISH Console**. Log in as the `root` user. To learn more, see [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH**: Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. To learn how, see [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/).

1.  Run the following command to access the credentials file:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

This returns passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Save them. Once saved, you can safely delete the file.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Drupal Site

To access your Drupal site:

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you entered when creating the instance: `https://domain.tld`. If you didn't provide a domain, use your Compute Instance's default rDNS domain (`192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). To learn more on viewing the rDNS value, see [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/). Make sure to use the `https` prefix in the URL to access the website securely.

The Drupal Marketplace App installs the following required software on your Linode:

| **Software** | **Description** |
