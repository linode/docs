[Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) provides a security solution for monitoring your infrastructure and detecting threats, intrusion attempts, system anomalies, poorly configured applications, and unauthorized user actions. It also provides a framework for incident response and regulatory compliance.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### View Credentials

1.  Log into your new Compute Instance through [LISH](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/) or [SSH](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/set-up-and-secure/#connect-to-the-instance) using either `root` user and the password you entered when creating the instance, or the generated sudo user and supplied SSH key.

1.  The usernames and passwords have been saved in the `/home/$SUDO_USER/.credentials` file, where sudo user is the user created during deployment. You can view this file in your preferred text editor or through the `cat` command.

    ```command
    cat /home/$SUDO_USER/.credentials
    ```

    This file contains all of your Wazuh credentials. The admin user and its associated password are needed when following the [Access the Wazuh App](#access-the-wazuh-app) section below.

    ```file {title="/home/$SUDO_USER/.credentials"}
    # Admin user for the web user interface and Wazuh indexer. Use this user to log in to Wazuh dashboard
      indexer_username: 'admin'
      indexer_password: '3O*NRpS5B5*sohufTz?TuM.Vef6zoN5d'

    # Wazuh dashboard user for establishing the connection with Wazuh indexer
      indexer_username: 'kibanaserver'
      indexer_password: 'Z.0M8rorxRS+DQfefe96N?.Cb+?byn7k'

    # Regular Dashboard user, only has READ permissions to all indices and all permissions on the .kibana index
      indexer_username: 'kibanaro'
      indexer_password: 'W?PVE08Pk2AYE8*brrg4Ni+LXAbBKJl++2II'

    # Filebeat user for CRUD operations on Wazuh indices
      indexer_username: 'logstash'
      indexer_password: 'FGH6rDIgrg.zvXz?qZfQ1dv?2QAAQuiX7'

    # User with READ access to all indices
      indexer_username: 'readall'
      indexer_password: 'jVVugegfB0ldF+fNN?0bS0iMviFe8RnY'

    # User with permissions to perform snapshot and restore operations
      indexer_username: 'snapshotrestore'
      indexer_password: 'YN17mfegnWy*efeL30KC1Zz.7yrhCma7'

    # Password for wazuh API user
      api_username: 'wazuh'
      api_password: 'PtE5y+esjMmB74g4ttjY+ds0lGfP??uk'

    # Password for wazuh-wui API user
      api_username: 'wazuh-wui'
      api_password: '6?PPR1o0fwfgefLiBjbYxBz+icG0rGojT'
    ```

### Access the Wazuh App

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you entered when creating the `https://domain.tld` instance. If you did not enter a domain, use your Compute Instance's default rDNS domain (`192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing the rDNS value. Ensure that you are securely accessing the website by prefixing `https` to the URL.

1.  In the login screen that appears, enter `admin` as the username and enter its corresponding password. Find the password by following the steps in the [View Credentials](#view-credentials) section.

### Set up a Wazuh Agent

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your Wazuh instance, you need to configure a [Wazuh Agent](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/index.html) on the server you'd like to monitor with Wazuh. Before you add the agent, allow the server you want to install the agent on access to ports '1514' and '1515' on your Wazuh instance. You can run the following ufw commands to do so:

```command
sudo ufw allow from $AGENTSERVERIP to any port 1514 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from $AGENTSERVERIP to any port 1515 proto tcp
```

**Note:** Update `$AGENTSERVERIP` with the IP address you want to install the wazuh-agent

Once the firewall rules are added, you can now follow the steps in the Wazuh UI to deploy the Wazuh Agent. The Agent installation asks you for the system package you are installing the agent on (RPM/DEB/Windows/macOS), the *Server Address* (Domain or IP address of your Wazuh), and the *Agent Name* (unique identifier for the instance you are installing the agent on).

- **Select the package to download and install on your system:** RPM, DEB, Windows, macOS (Example: DEB amd64)
- **Server address:** Domain or IP address of your newly installed Wazuh instance (Example: wazuhdomain.tld )
- **Assign an agent name:** A unique identifier for the instance you are installing the agent (Example: database1)

Once you enter that information, Wazuh displays the installation commands:

```command
wget https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/pool/main/w/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent_4.7.5-1_amd64.deb && sudo WAZUH_MANAGER='wazuhdomain.tld' WAZUH_AGENT_NAME='database1' dpkg -i ./wazuh-agent_4.7.5-1_amd64.deb
```
```command
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
```
