The OpenLiteSpeed Django app automatically installs Linux, the performance web server OpenLiteSpeed, Python LSAPI, and CertBot. OpenLiteSpeed Django features HTTP/3 support and easy setup for SSL and RewriteRules. It’s flexible enough to host multiple Django apps and supports many other apps including Node.js, Ruby, and CMS software like WordPress.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the OpenLiteSpeed Django App

1.  Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH, using the sudo user created during deployment or `root`. See [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) for assistance. You should see output similar to the following:

    ```output
    *********************************************************
    Akamai Connected Cloud OpenLiteSpeed Django Marketplace App
    App URL:
    * The OpenLiteSpeed Web Admin: https://$EXAMPLE_DOMAIN:7080
    * The sample Django site: https://EXAMPLE_DOMAIN/
    * The Django admin user: $DJANGO_USER
    * The sample Django admin page: https://$EXAMPLE_DOMAIN/admin
    Credentials File: /home/$SUDO_USER/.credentials
    Documentation: https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/linode/openlitespeed-django/
    *********************************************************
    ```

    You can view this message again by running `cat /etc/motd`. To delete this information, run `rm /etc/motd`.

1.  The Django page is automatically configured with the custom domain provided during deployment, or the default rDNS.

    {{< note >}}
    For more documentation on how to assign a domain to your Linode, please review the [DNS Manager](/docs/products/networking/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on setting up your DNS records in Cloud Manager, and read through [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/guides/dns-overview/) for general information about how DNS works.
