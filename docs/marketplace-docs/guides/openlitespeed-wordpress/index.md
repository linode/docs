This Marketplace App installs the OpenLiteSpeed web server, WordPress, the LiteSpeed caching plugin for WordPress, as well as other necessary software. Together, these applications provide an accelerated hosting platform for WordPress. [OpenLiteSpeed](https://openlitespeed.org/) is the open source edition of the LiteSpeed web server. It combines speed, security, scalability, optimization, and simplicity in one friendly open-source package.

## Getting Started After Deployment

Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH, using the `root` user or the sudo user created during deployment. See [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) for assistance. Once logged in, you should see Message of the Day output which includes OpenLiteSpeed HTTPS URLs:

```command
cat /etc/motd
```

```output
*********************************************************
Akamai Connected Cloud OpenLiteSpeed Wordpress Marketplace App
App URL:
* The Wordpress site: https://example-domain.tld/
* The Wordpress admin login site: https://example-domain.tld/wp-login.php
* The phpMyAdmin site: https://example-domain.tld/phpmyadmin
* The LiteSpeed admin site: https://example-domain.tld:7080/login.php
Credentials File: /home/$SUDO_USERNAME/.credentials
Documentation: https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/linode/openlitespeed-wordpress/
*********************************************************
```

The file `/home/$SUDO_USER/.credentials` includes chosen usernames and strong generated passwords for WordPress, OpenLiteSpeed and PHPMyAdmin users. It also includes passwords for the generated sudo user and MySQL root user.

### Accessing the WordPress Admin Dashboard

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `https://[domain]/wp-admin/`, where *[domain]* can be replaced with the custom domain you entered during deployment or your Compute Instance's rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). You can also use your IPv4 address, though the connection will not be secure. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing IP addresses and rDNS.

    {{< note >}}
    A TLS/SSL certificate is automatically generated for your custom domain, enabling you to connect to the site over the `https` protocol. If you did not enter a custom domain, a TLS/SSL certificate is configured on the rDNS domain instead. Connections using your IP address are not secured and will use the `http` protocol.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Within the login page that appears, enter the username (*admin username*) that you created when you deployed this instance and the associated password that was automatically generated. Then click the **Log In** button.
