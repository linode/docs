NirvaShare is a simplified and secure enterprise file sharing solution built on top of your existing file storage. Use NirvaShare with SFTP, local storage, or even S3-compatible storage like Linode's [Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/). Collaborate with your internal or external users such as customers, partners, and vendors. NirvaShare provides fine-tuned access control in a very simplified manner. NirvaShare integrates with multiple many external identity providers such as Active Directory, Google Workspace, AWS SSO, KeyClock, and others.

## Getting Started after Deployment

1. To access the NirvaShare login screen, open your web browser and navigate to `https://DOMAIN/`, where *DOMAIN* can be replaced with the custom domain you entered during deployment or your Compute Instance's rDNS domain (such as `192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing rDNS.

1. To login, enter `admin` as the *Username* and `admin` as the *Password*.
