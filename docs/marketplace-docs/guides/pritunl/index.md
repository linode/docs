## Getting Started after Deployment

### Obtain the Credentials

Once the app is deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

To obtain credentials:

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console**: Log in to Cloud Manager, click the **Linodes** link in the left menu, and select the Compute Instance you just deployed. Click **Launch LISH Console**. Log in as the `root` user. To learn more, see [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH**: Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. To learn how, see [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/).

1.  Run the following command to access the credentials file:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

This returns passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Save them. Once saved, you can safely delete the file.

### Accessing the Pritunl App

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you entered when creating the instance: `https://domain.tld`. If you didn't enter a domain, use your Compute Instance's default rDNS domain (`192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). To learn more on viewing the rDNS value, see [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/). Make sure to use the `https` prefix in the URL to access the website securely.

    {{< note >}}
    In Chrome, you can accept the self-signed certificate by clicking **Advanced** and then **Proceed to** <ip> (unsafe). In Firefox, click **Advanced**, then **Add Exception**, and **Confirm Security Exception**.

1.  To log in, enter `pritunl` as the username and the password you generated in the credentials file.

1.  Change the default password and enter the domain information so Pritunl can setup the SSL certificates automatically:

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your dashboard, check out [the official Pritunl documentation](https://docs.pritunl.com/docs/connecting) to learn how to add users and use your Pritunl instance.
