[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) is an open source monitoring tool. It enables you to monitor services over HTTP/S, TCP, DNS, and other protocols. You can receive notification alerts of downtime and even create custom status pages for your users.

### Obtain the Credentials

Once the app has been *fully* deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console:** Within Cloud Manager, navigate to **Linodes** from the left menu, select the Compute Instance you just deployed, and click the **Launch LISH Console** button. Log in as the `root` user. See [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH:** Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. See [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) for assistance.

1.  Once logged in, access the credentials file by running the following command:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

1.  This displays the passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Once you save these passwords, you can safely delete this file.

## Getting Started After Deployment

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you entered when creating the instance: `https://domain.tld`. If you did not enter a domain, use your Compute Instance's default rDNS domain (`192-0-2-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com`). See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/manage-ip-addresses/) guide for information on viewing the rDNS value. Ensure that you are securely accessing the website by prefixing `https` to the URL.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your dashboard, check out [the official Uptime Kuma Repository](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) to learn how to further use your Uptime Kuma instance.
