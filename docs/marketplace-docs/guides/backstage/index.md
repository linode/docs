Backstage is an open-source platform for building developer portals designed to simplify and unify software development processes. It provides a centralized hub for managing services, tools, and documentation. Backstage enables teams to improve efficiency, collaboration, and scalability across projects.

## Prerequisites

The Backstage application for Cloud Manager is configured with a Github authentication and allows you to integrate pulling catalog entities from Github directly. Before you can deploy the One-Click application, you need to create an OAuth application and authorize it to use your domain name.

To learn how to configure authentication to Github, see [Setting up authentication](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/config/authentication/#setting-up-authentication).

For reference, you can use the following image as a guideline to configure the OAuth application.

{{< note >}}
Optionally, you can configure the [Github integration](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/config/authentication/#setting-up-a-github-integration), but it's not required for the deployment of the Backstage One-Click app.

You only need to perform instructions from the linked sections. No need to perform following steps from linked pages.
Once done, save the following data to use in the following steps:

- Client ID,
- Client Secret,
- Personal Access Token (not required).
