The MySQL/MariaDB Marketplace app can deploy MySQL or MariaDB. MySQL is an open-source database management system that uses a relational database and SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage its data. MariaDB is an open-source, multi-threaded relational database management system, backward compatible replacement for MySQL that's maintained and developed by the MariaDB Foundation.

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** The app should be fully installed within 2-5 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Suggested plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used. We suggest using a [High Memory Compute Instance](https://www.linode.com/products/high-memory/) for larger databases in a production environment.

### MySQL/MariaDB Options

- **MySQL or MariaDB** *(required)*: Select which database service you'd like to use.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Obtain the Credentials

Once the app is deployed, you need to obtain the credentials from the server.

To obtain credentials:

1.  Log in to your new Compute Instance using one of the methods below:

    - **Lish Console**: Log in to Cloud Manager, click the **Linodes** link in the left menu, and select the Compute Instance you just deployed. Click **Launch LISH Console**. Log in as the `root` user. To learn more, see [Using the Lish Console](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/).
    - **SSH**: Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH using the `root` user. To learn how, see [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/).

1.  Run the following command to access the credentials file:

    ```command
    cat /home/$USERNAME/.credentials
    ```

This returns passwords that were automatically generated when the instance was deployed. Save them. Once saved, you can safely delete the file.

## Using MySQL/MariaDB

The standard tool for interacting with MySQL is the `mysql` client which installs with the `mysql-server` package. The MySQL client is used through a terminal.

### Root Login

1.  To log in to MySQL as the root user:

        sudo mysql -u root -p

1.  When prompted, enter the MySQL root password that was provided in the `/home/$USERNAME/.credentials` file. You get a welcome header and the MySQL prompt.

1.  To generate a list of commands for the MySQL prompt, enter `\h`. You'll then see:

        List of all MySQL commands:
        Note that all text commands must be first on line and end with ';'
        ?         (\?) Synonym for `help'.
        clear     (\c) Clear command.
        connect   (\r) Reconnect to the server. Optional arguments are db and host.
        delimiter (\d) Set statement delimiter. NOTE: Takes the rest of the line as new delimiter.
        edit      (\e) Edit command with $EDITOR.
        ego       (\G) Send command to mysql server, display result vertically.
        exit      (\q) Exit mysql. Same as quit.
        go        (\g) Send command to mysql server.
        help      (\h) Display this help.
        nopager   (\n) Disable pager, print to stdout.
        notee     (\t) Don't write into outfile.
        pager     (\P) Set PAGER [to_pager]. Print the query results via PAGER.
        print     (\p) Print current command.
        prompt    (\R) Change your mysql prompt.
        quit      (\q) Quit mysql.
        rehash    (\#) Rebuild completion hash.
        source    (\.) Execute an SQL script file. Takes a filename as an argument.
        status    (\s) Get status information from the server.
        system    (\!) Execute a system shell command.
        tee       (\T) Set outfile [to_outfile]. Append everything into given outfile.
        use       (\u) Use another database. Takes database name as argument.
        charset   (\C) Switch to another charset. Might be needed for processing binlog with multi-byte charsets.
        warnings  (\W) Show warnings after every statement.
        nowarning (\w) Don't show warnings after every statement.

        For server side help, type 'help contents'

### Create a Sample Table

1.  Log back in as sudo user that you set when launching the Marketplace App. In the following example the sudo user is `webuser`.

        sudo mysql -u webuser -p

2.  Create a sample table called `customers`. This creates a table with a customer ID field of the type `INT` for integer (auto-incremented for new records, used as the primary key), as well as two fields for storing the customer's name. In the following example `webdata` is the database that you created when launching the Marketplace App.

        use webdata;
        create table customers (customer_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, first_name TEXT, last_name TEXT);

3.  To view the contents of the table that you created, enter the command:

        describe customers;

       The output would be:

        +-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
        | Field       | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
        +-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
        | customer_id | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
        | first_name  | text    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
        | last_name   | text    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
        +-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

4. To exit MySQL/MariaDB, enter:

        exit
