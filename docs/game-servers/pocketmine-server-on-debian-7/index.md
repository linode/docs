PocketMine is a third party server for the MineCraft - Pocket Edition game for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143?mt=8). It features plugin support, allowing you to customize your gameplay with others. This guide details installing PocketMine on a Linode running Debian 7.

{{< note >}}
Minecraft - Pocket Edition is non-free software that you will need to purchase in order to take advantage of a PocketMine server.
{{< /note >}}

## Prerequisites

1.  Your Linode should already be configured per our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide, and secured per our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide.

2.  Ensure that your Linode is up to date:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

3.  Install dependencies:

        sudo apt-get install perl gcc g++ make automake libtool autoconf m4

4.  Create a user for the PocketMine server:

        sudo adduser pocketmine

    {{< note >}}
If you've followed the steps in our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide, you will need to add your public key to `/home/pocketmine/.ssh/authorized_keys` in order to log in as this user later in the guide. You will also need to add an iptables exception for port `19132`
{{< /note >}}

## Installation

1.  Log in as the `pocketmine` user and go to its home directory:

        cd ~/

2.  Download and run the PocketMine installer script:

        wget -q -O - http://get.pocketmine.net/ | bash

    The installation will take several minutes.

## Running PocketMine Server

1.  Run the `start.sh` script within a GNU-screen instance:

        screen ./start.sh

    {{< note >}}
If you've used `su` to switch to the pocketmine user, you will get an error message stating `Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check.` when attempting to start screen. You can resolve this by first running the command:

script /dev/null
{{< /note >}}

    {{< caution >}}
PocketMine may not run properly on systems not running PHP7. You can manually install it, or modify `start.sh`, replacing all instances of `php7` with `php5`:

sed -i -e 's/php7/php5/g' start.sh
{{< /caution >}}

2.  The set-up wizard will begin by asking you to select a language. Enter the two-character value for your language of choice, or just press **return** for English.
