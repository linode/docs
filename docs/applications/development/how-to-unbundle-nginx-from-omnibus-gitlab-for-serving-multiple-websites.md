Omnibus GitLab is a software package that allows you to easily install and run GitLab together with some dependencies (Ruby, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx and Unicorn, among others).

However, one-click installs sometimes bring a series of challenges to those who need to customize specific default settings. If this is your case, you might even consider [installing GitLab from source](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/development/how-to-install-and-configure-gitlab-on-ubuntu-14-04-trusty-tahr "How to Install and Configure GitLab on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)"), but this is a bit tricky for some users.

One drawback to Omnibus is that was designed to run one single Nginx server per machine. Thus, Omnibus's nginx was tied to GitLab and you simply couldn't take advantage of your server's potential by running multiple virtual hosts. However, newer versions of Omnibus CE allow developers to disable GitLab's nginx and install their own web server without having to compile anything.

This guide walks you through the process of installing and setting up your own nginx server on a typical Omnibus installation. This way, you are not forced to use Omnibus' default settings, and can create as many virtual hosts as you want for hosting multiple websites and apps on the same server as GitLab.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. 

3.  This guide has been tested with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS. Some commands will be slightly different for each version, so be sure to read each step carefully for version-specific instructions.

4.  Update your system:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Install Omnibus GitLab

If you're already running an Omnibus GitLab environment you can take this moment to [upgrade to the newest version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/doc/update.md). If you're installing GitLab for the first time, this section will explain how to do so.

Note that nginx cannot be disabled in older versions of GitLab CE. If this is your case and you have installed an older version, it is recommended to upgrade incrementally so that the major new features and fixes won't break anything. 

1.  Install the necessary dependencies:

        sudo apt-get install curl openssh-server ca-certificates postfix

2.  While installing Postfix, you'll be asked to configure a few basic settings. On the first [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) screen, select **Internet Site** as the mail configuration. On the second screen, enter your fully qualified domain name. This will be used when sending email to users when configuring new accounts and resetting passwords. The rest of the mail options will be configured automatically.

3.  Add the GitLab CE repository and install the `gitlab-ce` package:

        curl -sS https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
        sudo apt-get install gitlab-ce

    You can view the above script in its entirety on the [GitLab website](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce/install) if you're hesitant to run it sight-unseen. The [GitLab downloads page](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/) also contains an alternative download method if you're still not comfortable running their script.

## Unbundle Nginx from Omnibus GitLab

1.  To unbundle nginx from GitLab, we'll need to disable the version included in the Omnibus package. Add the following lines to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

    {: .file-excerpt}
    /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
    :   ~~~
	    # Unbundle nginx from Omnibus GitLab
	    nginx['enable'] = false
	    # Set your Nginx's username
	    web_server['external_users'] = ['www-data']
        ~~~

2.  Reconfigure GitLab to apply the changes:

	    sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure

For more information on how to customize Omnibus Nginx please [click here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/doc/settings/nginx.md) to read the official documentation.

## Install Ruby, Passenger, and Nginx

Well done! At this point, GitLab's bundled nginx has been disabled. The next step is to install and configure the web server from scratch.

1.  Since GitLab is written in Ruby, install Ruby on your system:

		sudo apt-get install ruby
		sudo gem install rubygems-update
		sudo update_rubygems

2.  We'll also need to install Phusion Passenger, a web application server for Ruby. Install Phusion Passenger's PGP key:
		
        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 561F9B9CAC40B2F7
		
3.	Add Passenger's APT repository by adding the following lines to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/passenger.list`:
		
    {: .file}
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/passenger.list
    :   ~~~
        deb https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/apt/passenger trusty main
	    ~~~

    {: .note}
    > If you're using Ubuntu 16.04, replace `trusty` with `xenial` in the above command.
        
4.  Update your package repositories:

    	sudo apt-get update

5.	Install Passenger and nginx:
		
        sudo apt-get install nginx-extras passenger

6.  Enable your brand new Passenger module by uncommenting the `include /etc/nginx/passenger.conf;` line from the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file:

    {: .file-excerpt}
    /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    :   ~~~ conf
        include /etc/nginx/passenger.conf;
        ~~~

4.  Finally, restart nginx. On Ubuntu 14.04:

		sudo service nginx restart

    On Ubuntu 16.04:

        sudo systemctl restart nginx

For further information, please refer to [Installing Passenger + Nginx on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (with APT)](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/nginx/install/oss/trusty/ "Installing Passenger + Nginx").

## Create a New Virtual Host

In this section, we'll create a new virtual host to serve GitLab. Since we unbundled nginx, we'll also be able to configure other virtual hosts for other websites and apps.

1.  Copy the default virtual host file to a new virtual host file, replacing `example.com` with the name you'd like to use for your virtual host:

	    sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com

2.  Edit your new virtual host file to match the following, replacing `example.com` with your own hostname:

    {: .file}
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
    :   ~~~
	    upstream gitlab {
       	    server unix:/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/sockets/gitlab.socket;
	    }

	    server {
            listen 80;
            server_name example.com;
            server_tokens off; # don't show the version number, a security best practice
            root /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails/public;

            # Increase this if you want to upload large attachments
            # Or if you want to accept large git objects over http
            client_max_body_size 250m;

            # individual nginx logs for this gitlab vhost
            access_log  /var/log/nginx/gitlab_access.log;
            error_log   /var/log/nginx/gitlab_error.log;

            location / {
                proxy_redirect off;
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_pass http://gitlab;
		    }
	    }
        ~~~

3.  Enable your new virtual host by symbolically linking it to `sites-enabled`:

	    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com

4.  Restart Nginx to load your changes. On Ubuntu 14.04:

        sudo service nginx restart

    On Ubuntu 16.04:

        sudo systemctl restart nginx

5.  Since Nginx needs to access GitLab, add the `www-data` user to the `gitlab-www` group:

	    sudo usermod -aG gitlab-www www-data

Congratulations! You have turned a default Omnibus GitLab server into a multi-purpose one. To serve additional websites and apps using your newly unbundled nginx server, simply create additional virtual hosts above, and configure them to your needs.
