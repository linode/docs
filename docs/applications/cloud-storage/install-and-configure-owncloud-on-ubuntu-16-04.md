OwnCloud is an open-source, cloud-based, file hosting service you can install on your Linode. OwnCloud offers a quick installation process, works out of the box, and has an extensive library of plugins available. Its cross-platform compatibility means you can access your files from most major operating systems, browsers, and mobile devices.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services.

3.  [Install and configure a LAMP stack](/docs/web-servers/lamp/install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04).

4.  Update your system:

        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

## Install ownCloud

Add the repository key to apt, and install ownCloud:

    sudo wget -nv https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/9.1/Ubuntu_16.04/Release.key -O Release.key
    sudo apt-key add - < Release.key
    sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/9.1/Ubuntu_16.04/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/owncloud.list"
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install owncloud

## Configure MySQL

1.  Log in to your MySQL database, and enter your root password:

        mysql -u root -p

2.  Create a new database for ownCloud, and replace `strong_password` with a new, secure password:

        CREATE DATABASE ownCloud;
        CREATE USER ownCloud@localhost;
        SET PASSWORD FOR 'ownCloud'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('strong_password');

3.  Assign the new user to the database:

        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ownCloud.* to ownCloud@localhost;
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        exit

4.  Log into MySQL as the newly created user:

        mysql -u ownCloud -p

5.  You can check the current user in MySQL using the `SELECT current_user();` command:

        select current_user();

    Which will display something similar to:

        +--------------------+
        | current_user()     |
        +--------------------+
        | ownCloud@localhost |
        +--------------------+
        1 row in set (0.00 sec)

## Create an Administrator Account

1. After ownCloud is installed and MySQL is configured, point your browser to `ip_address_or_domain/owncloud` (where, `ip_address_or_domain` is your IP or FQDN) and create an administrator account:

2.  Click **Storage & database** and enter the database login information:

    ![ownCloud database information](/docs/assets/ownCloud/dbinfo.png)

    Welcome to ownCloud:

    ![ownCloud greeting](/docs/assets/ownCloud/owncloud.png)

## Install ClamAV and Configure ownCloud

1.  Install [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/), an open source antivirus engine which works with ownCloud's antivirus plugin:

        sudo apt install clamav clamav-daemon

    The `clamav` package starts a daemon on your system.

2.  Enable the antivirus app in ownCloud. Select **Apps** from the menu, then **Not enabled** to find "Antivirus App for files" and click **Enable**:

3.  Configure the antivirus mode in ownCloud to reflect the changes to your system:

    ![Antivirus socket configuration](/docs/assets/ownCloud/owncloud_socket.png)

4.  To add new users and groups, select **Users** in the dropdown menu in the upper right-hand corner:

    ![User configuration panel](/docs/assets/ownCloud/owncloudusers.png)

## Secure the System

Now that ownCloud is installed and configured, you should secure your system. The official documentation has a well-written section on [hardening your server](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9.0/admin_manual/configuration_server/harden_server.html), which covers everything from using HTTPS, to JavaScript Asset Managing.
