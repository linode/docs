Seafile is a cross-platform file hosting tool with server applications for Linux and Windows, and GUI clients for Android, iOS, Linux, OS X and Windows. It supports file versioning and snapshots, two-factor authentication, WebDAV, and can be paired with NGINX or Apache to enable connections over HTTPS.

Seafile has [two editions](https://www.seafile.com/en/product/private_server/): a free and open source Community Edition and a paid Professional edition. While the Professional edition is free for up to 3 users, this guide will use Seafile Community Edition with NGINX serving an HTTPS connection, and MySQL on the backend. This application stack could also benefit from large amounts of disk space, so consider using our [Block Storage](/docs/platform/how-to-use-block-storage-with-your-linode/) service with this setup.

## Prepare Ubuntu

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Linux Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.
{{< /note >}}

1.  This guide assumes you have a basic server setup. Before moving forward, check to see that you have completed the objectives outlined in the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) and [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server/) guides. If not, these steps should be completed before proceeding.

2.  Update the system:

        sudo apt update && apt upgrade

## Install and Configure MariaDB 10.0

Seafile stores synced data in MySQL server. MariaDB 10 will be used in this installation, but other MySQL variants and versions should work. If you have a variant already installed, check the [Seafile Manual](https://manual.seafile.com/) and confirm it can be used with Seafile.

1.  Install required packages.

        sudo apt install software-properties-common

2.  Fetch the MariaDB repository GPG key.

        sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xF1656F24C74CD1D8

3.  Add the MariaDB Server repository.

        sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64] http://mirror.zol.co.zw/mariadb/repo/10.3/ubuntu bionic main'

4.  Install MariaDB Server.

    You will be prompted several times to set a password for the MySQL root user during installation. Leave the password input blank and press `Enter` to skip this step, as it will be addressed in the next step.

        apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client

5.  Run the *mysql_secure_installation* script. Set a root password for the MySQL root user and answer `Y` to all following questions.

        sudo mysql_secure_installation

        Set root password? [Y/n] Y
        Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
        Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
        Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
        Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y


## Install and Configure NGINX With Let's Encrypt

The configuration setup below works in tandem with Let's Encrypt to provide SSL protection to your Seafile installation.

1.  Install NGINX from Ubuntu's repository

        sudo apt install nginx
        sudo systemctl start nginx
        sudo systemctl enable nginx

2.  Install Let's Encrypt

    Press `Enter` to accept the prompt in the first command.

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
        sudo apt install python-certbot-nginx

3.  Issue a new SSL certificate for your Seafile site. Replace 'your@email-address' with your own e-mail address.

    Select your Seafile site in the options given to issue the certificate.

        certbot --nginx --rsa-key-size 4096 --agree-tos --no-eff-email --email your@email-address

4.  Create a config file for Certbot at `/etc/nginx/snippets/certbot.conf`

    {{< file "/etc/nginx/snippets/certbot.conf" nginx >}}
location /.well-known {
    alias /var/www/html/.well-known;
}
{{< /file >}}

5.  Create the site configuration file. The only lines you need to change below are the two `server_name` lines, `ssl_certificate`, and `ssl_certificate_key`. `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` locations can be found in the output of the certbot command you ran in step three. For more HTTPS configuration options, see our guide on [TLS Best Practices with NGINX](/docs/web-servers/nginx/nginx-ssl-and-tls-deployment-best-practices/).

    {{< file "/etc/nginx/sites-available/seafile.conf" nginx >}}

    }

    location /media {
        root /opt/installed/seafile-server-6.2.5/seahub;
    }

    include snippets/certbot.conf;
}

{{< /file >}}

    {{< note >}}
If you plan on uploading large files (greater or equal to 4GB), you may want to turn off the Nginx buffer feature, as it has issues handling large files with Seafile. Add the following to the *seafile.conf* file in the `/seafhttp` location section.

  {{< file "/etc/nginx/sites-available/seafile.conf" conf >}}
  ...
  location /seafhttp {
        ... ...
        proxy_request_buffering off;
  }
  ...
{{< /file >}}

{{< /note >}}

6.  Disable the default site configuration and enable the one you just created:

        sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
        sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seafile.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seafile.conf

7.  Run the NGINX configuration test and restart the web server. If the test fails, it will give you a brief description of what's wrong so you can troubleshoot the problem.

        sudo nginx -t
        sudo systemctl restart nginx

## Configure and Install Seafile

The [Seafile manual](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/using_mysql.html) advises to use a particular directory structure to ease upgrades. We'll do the same here, but instead of using the example `haiwen` directory found in the Seafile manual, we'll install everything in the `opt` directory.

1.  Download the Seafile CE 64 bit Linux server. You'll need to get the exact link from [seafile.com](https://www.seafile.com/en/download/). Once you have the URL, use `wget` to download it to the **/opt** directory. An example is show below using the latest Seafile server package available as of this guide's publication date.

        wget --directory-prefix=/opt https://download.seadrive.org/seafile-server_6.2.5_x86-64.tar.gz

2.  Extract the tarball and move it when finished:

        tar -xzvf seafile-server*.tar.gz
        mkdir installed && mv seafile-server-6.2.5 installed

3.  Install dependency packages for Seafile:

        sudo apt install python2.7 libpython2.7 python-setuptools python-pil python-ldap python-urllib3 ffmpeg python-pip python-mysqldb python-memcache python-requests -y

4.  Run the installation script:

        cd /opt/installed/seafile-server-6.2.5
        ./setup-seafile-mysql.sh

    You'll be prompted to answer several questions and choose settings during the installation process. Answer the questions with the default value when provided with one.

5.  If you have a firewall in place, port 8082 and 8000 must be opened. The Iptables method is shown below.

        iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 -m multiport --dports 8000,8082 -j ACCEPT
        iptables-save

6.  Start the Seafile and Seahub servers.

        ./seafile.sh start
        ./seahub.sh start

    The `seahub.sh` script will set up an admin user account used to log into Seafile. You'll be asked for a login email and to create a password.

    [![First time starting Seafile](seafile-firststart-small.png)](seafile-firststart.png)

7.  Seafile should now be accessible from a web browser using both your Linode's IP address or the `server_name` you set earlier in NGINX's `seafile.conf` file.

    [![Seafile login prompt](seafile-login-small.png)](seafile-login.png)

## Automatically Start Seafile on Sever Bootup

The `seafile.sh` and `seahub.sh` scripts don't automatically run if your Linode were to reboot. Set up the `seafile` and `seahub` services to run at boot.

1.  Create the systemd unit files:

    {{< file "/etc/systemd/system/seafile.service" >}}

[Unit]
Description=Seafile Server
After=network.target mysql.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/opt/installed/seafile-server-6.2.5/seafile.sh start
ExecStop=/opt/installed/seafile-server-6.2.5/seafile.sh stop
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

{{< /file >}}

    {{< file "/etc/systemd/system/seahub.service" >}}

[Unit]
Description=Seahub Server
After=network.target mysql.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/opt/installed/seafile-server-6.2.5/seahub.sh start
ExecStop=/opt/installed/seafile-server-6.2.5/seahub.sh stop
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

{{< /file >}}

2.  Then enable the services to automate the startup of both daemons during server boot.

        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl start seafile
        sudo systemctl start seahub
        sudo systemctl enable seafile
        sudo systemctl enable seahub

    You can verify they've started successfully with the following commands.

        sudo systemctl -l status seafile
        sudo systemctl -l status seahub

3.  Confirm the startup scripts are working by rebooting your Linode. After bootup, both the Seafile and Seahub services should be active when running the status commands in the previous step. You should also still be able to access Seafile with a web browser.


## Updating Seafile

There are various ways to update Seafile depending on if you are upgrading from one milestone to another (version 5 to 6), or upgrading between point releases (5.1.0 to 5.1.1). See the [Seafile Manual](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/upgrade.html) for upgrade instructions that best suit your needs.

# Where To Go From here

Upon installation of Seafile, studying the [Seafile Manual](https://manual.seafile.com/) for additional improvements available for your specific setup is the best way to improve your installation. For those taking advantage of SSL encryption, generating a DH Param key will immediately improve the security of your site, and can be done by following the instructions in the [Seafile Manual](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/https_with_nginx.html) starting at the *Generate DH Params* section.
