![Turtl_Banner](/docs/assets/turtl/Turtl.jpg)

[Turtl](https://turtlapp.com/docs) is an open-source alternative to cloud-based storage services. With a focus on privacy, Turtl offers a place to store and access your passwords, bookmarks and pictures. Hosting your own Turtl server on a secure Linode allows you to monitor your own security.

The Turtl server is written in Common Lisp, and the low-level encryption is derived from the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library. If encryption is important to you, read over the [encryption specifics](https://turtlapp.com/docs/security/encryption-specifics/) section of the official documentation.


## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do **not** follow the Configure a Firewall section yet. This guide includes firewall rules specifically for an OpenVPN server.

3.  Update your system:

        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade


### Install Dependencies:

The Turtl server has to be built from source. Download all of the dependencies as well as git:

    apt install wget curl libtool subversion make automake git


### Libuv, RethinkDB, Clozure Common Lisp, QuickLisp:


#### Libuv

Download the Libuv package from the official repository:

	wget https://dist.libuv.org/dist/v1.13.0/libuv-v1.13.0.tar.gz
	tar -xvf libuv-v1.13.0.tar.gz

Build the package from source:

    cd libuv-v1.13.0
    sudo sh autogen.sh
	sudo ./configure
	sudo make
	sudo make install

After the package is built, run `sudo ldconfig` to maintain the shared libracy cache.

#### RethinkDB

[RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/faq/) is a flexible JSON datbase. According to the Turtl [documentation](https://turtlapp.com/docs/server/), RethinkDB just needs to be installed; Turtl will take care of the rest.

RehinkDB has community-maintained packages on most distributions. On Ubuntu, you have to add the RethinkDB to your list of repositories:

    source /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt $xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rethinkdb.list
    wget -qO- https://download.rethinkdb.com/apt/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Navigate to your `sources.list` folder and add your version of Ubuntu:

    vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rethinkdb.list
    deb http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt xenial main

Update apt and install RethinkDB:

     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install rethinkdb

Navigate to `/etc/rethinkdb/` and rename `default.conf.sample` to `default.conf`

    sudo mv /etc/rethinkdb/default.conf.sample /etc/rethinkdb/default.conf

Restart the `rethinkdb.service` daemon:

    sudo systemctl restart rethinkdb.service


#### Clozure Common Lisp

For this installation you will need to install Clozure Common Lisp (CCL):


    svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/release/1.11/linuxx86/ccl

According to the CCL [documentation](https://ccl.clozure.com/download.html), you can replace `linuxx86` with another platform, like `solarisx86`.

Quickly check if CCL has been installed correctly by updating the sources:

    cd ccl
	svn update

Move `ccl` to `/usr/bin` so `ccl` can run from the command line:

    cd ..
    sudo cp -r ccl/ /usr/local/src
	sudo cp /usr/local/src/ccl/scripts/ccl64 /usr/local/bin

Now, running `ccl64`, or `ccl` depending on your system, will launch a Lisp environment:

    linode@localhost:~$ ccl64
    Welcome to Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.11-r16635  (LinuxX8664)!

    CCL is developed and maintained by Clozure Associates. For more information
    about CCL visit http://ccl.clozure.com.  To enquire about Clozure's Common Lisp
    consulting services e-mail info@clozure.com or visit http://www.clozure.com.

To exit the environment type `(quit)`.

#### QuickLisp and ASDF

Create a user named `turtl`:

    adduser turtl
    su turtl

QuickLisp is to Lisp what `pip` is to Python. Turtl loads its dependencies for the server through Quicklisp. ASDF is a tool that builds Lisp software.

    wget https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp

    ccl64 --load quicklisp.lisp

The successful execution of the above steps will open the CCL environment with the following output:

{:.output}
~~~
     ==== quicklisp quickstart 2015-01-28 loaded ====

To continue with installation, evaluate: (quicklisp-quickstart:install)

  For installation options, evaluate: (quicklisp-quickstart:help)

Welcome to Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.11-r16635  (LinuxX8664)!

CCL is developed and maintained by Clozure Associates. For more information
about CCL visit http://ccl.clozure.com.  To enquire about Clozure's Common Lisp
consulting services e-mail info@clozure.com or visit http://www.clozure.com.
~~~

Once you are in the CCL enviroment, install QuickLisp using:

    (quicklisp-quickstart:install)

After the install finishes, add Quicklisp into your init file.

    (ql:add-to-init-file)

After confirming the settings, Quicklisp will start when `ccl64` starts. `(quit)` out of CCL for now.

Download ASDF:

    wget https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.lisp

Load and install `asdf.lisp` in your CCL environment:

    ccl64 --load quicklisp.lisp
	(load (compile-file "asdf.lisp"))
	(quit)


### Install Turtl

Clone Turtl from the Github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/turtl/api.git


Create a file called `launch.lisp` inside `/api` and copy the commands below:

    touch launch.lisp
    vi launch.lisp

    (pushnew "./" asdf:*central-registry* :test #'equal)
    (load "start")

Turtl does not ship with all of its dependencies. Instead, the Turtl community provides a list of dependencies. Clone these into `/home/turtl/quicklisp/local-projects`:

    echo "https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-hash-util https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async https://github.com/orthecreedence/cffi https://github.com/orthecreedence/wookie https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-rethinkdb https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-libuv https://github.com/orthecreedence/drakma-async https://github.com/Inaimathi/cl-cwd.git" > dependencies.txt

    for repo in `cat dependencies.txt`; do `git clone $repo`; done

Edit the `/home/turtl/.ccl-init.lisp` to include:

    (cwd "/home/turtl/api")
	(load "/home/turtl/api/launch")

The first line tells Lisp to use the `cl-cwd` package that you cloned to change the current working directory to `/home/turtl/api`. You can change this to anything, but your naming conventions should be consistent. The second line loads your `launch.lisp`, loading `asdf` so that Turtl can run.

Create the default Turtl configuration file:

    cp /home/turtl/api/config/config.default.lisp /home/turtl/api/config/config.lisp

The `config.lisp` file is where the configurations for your server are stored. If you want to connect to your Linode from a Turtl desktop or mobile client, you need to add the Linode's public IP address to:


    (defvar *site-url* "http://1.0.0.0:8181"
       "The main URL the site will load from.")


Go to your home directory and run `ccl64`. This will automatically start the Turtl server.

On your local device, download a client app for Turtl from the [turtl website](https://turtlapp.com/download/) for supported devices and operating systems.

![turtldownload](/docs/assets/turtl/turtl_download.png)


Put your public facing IP address (or `http://localhost:8181` if running locally) when prompted and create a username.

![turtlinfo](/docs/assets/turtl/enterip.png)

You now have a functioning Turtl server. Add files, store passwords, and save bookmarks in your own private Turtl instance.


### Next Steps

Turtl does not have much official documentation. Fred C has created an install guide for Turtl on Debian that is also very helpful for making it work on Ubuntu 16.10. Take a look at the Turtl Google Group, and Fred C's guide:
