[Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/) is an open source social networking app that's very similar to Facebook groups. It promotes itself as a way for groups to easily make decisions together. Each thread/discussion within a group or sub-group has access to a number of tools which are all geared towards making decisions.

![Loomio screenshot](/docs/assets/loomio-screenshot01.png "Loomio screenshot ")

This guide covers the installation and environment setup to run a development or production version with a reverse proxy like Nginx.

Loomio is built with AngularJS, CoffeeScript, Sass and Haml (HTML abstraction markup language). It runs in the Ruby on Rails using Postgresql as the database and Ruby Thin & Puma web server.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Remember to open any ports used in this guide in your choosen firewall.

3.  Update your system:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

4.  This guide uses nano for editing files and curl for downloads. 

        sudo apt-get install nano curl

{: .caution}
>
> This install of Loomio requires an older version of Node.js. This guide uses [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (NVM) to achieve this. Although the commands are included, you may want to famiiarise yourself with the [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) project and be aware of how installing it could effect any Node dependant packages currently on your server. You should `node -v` to check what version you may be currently running.

{: .note}
>
> This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

This guide assumes that loomio is cloned to the current Linux user home. Replace each instance of `/home/[user]/loomio` with your Linux logged in user home or amend this and `~/loomio` with your cloned loomio path.

## Install Node via Node Version Manager (NVM)

1.  **Read the Node caution above** Install the latest version of NVM see [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) for up-to-date curl command

        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash

2.  source .bashrc or close and reopen your terminal

        source .bashrc

3.  Check NVM has installed successfully, response should be `nvm`

        command -v nvm

4.  At the time of writing Loomio required Node v7.4.0 so lets use NVM to install it. To check which version Loomio currently requires look in ` https://github.com/loomio/loomio/blob/master/angular/package.json`

        nvm install v7.4.0

{: .note}
>
> You may see this message if you have Node already installed without NVM *nvm is not compatible with the npm config "prefix" option: currently set to "/home/[user]/.npm-global" Run npm config delete prefix or nvm use --delete-prefix v7.4.0 to unset it* 

5.  If you did see this message, lets do what it says.

        nvm use --delete-prefix v7.4.0

6.  Check if the required Node version is in use.

        node -v

## Install and configure Postgresql Server and Setup Databases

1.  Check which version of *postgresql-server-dev* is available

        apt-cache search postgresql-server-dev

2.  Install Postgres, replace *postgresql-server-dev-x.y* with available version

        sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-x.y

3.  Login to Postgres cli with default user `postgres` and sudo password

        sudo -u postgres psql postgres

4.  Set a password for user>postgres so non-sudo users can connect to postgres databases. \q and enter to exit

        \password postgres
        \q

5.  Check Postgres is up and running

        sudo service postgresql status

## Install Ruby, Bundler and Dependencies

1.  Install Ruby

        sudo apt-get install ruby-full

2.  Install Bundler using gem. Bundler uses bundles to install the right gem dependencies and versions specified by the Loomio team. Visit [bundler.io](https://bundler.io/) to find out more.

        sudo gem install bundler

3.  Install dependencies that Loomio requires

        sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev git build-essential libffi-dev imagemagick apt-transport-https

## Git Clone Loomio, Bundle Install, Gulp/Node Modules Install

1.  Clone the latest Loomio source from Github to your home directory

        git clone https://github.com/loomio/loomio.git

2.  Enter the Loomio git clone directory and install bundle. NOTE: The following steps assume that your current working directory is the Loomio root clone.

        bundle install --path vendor/bundle

3.  Create a .nvmrc file to force NVM to always use the correct Node version. Replace with current Loomio recommended version.

        echo 7.4.0 > .nvmrc

4.  Install Node Gulp globally

        npm install -g gulp

5.  Enter Angular directory and install Node modules.

        cd angular && npm install && cd ../

{: .note}
>
> If you get any unmet dependencies you can try `npm install` again or install the missing packages individually `npm i [package name]`

## Build Loomio Database

1.  Create Postgresql database.yml File. NOTE: The following steps assume that your current working directory is the Loomio root clone.

        nano config/database.yml

2.  Add the following and edit with your Postgres database name, username and password we configured in the Postgresql section.

```
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: loomio_development
  pool: 5
  username: postgres
  password: [postgres password]
  host: localhost
      
test:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: loomio_test
  pool: 5
  username: postgres
  password: [postgres password]
  host: localhost
      
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: loomio_production
  pool: 5
  username: [production postges user]
  password: [production postges password]
  host: localhost
```

3.  Use 'rake' (Ruby Make) to build the database and create a Loomio user login. This will need to be done for each database (not production - see 'Production Environment Additional Setup' section below). db:setup will create the database with the details specified in config/database.yml alternatively you could create databases with `sudo -u postgres createdb loomio_development` to delete a database use `sudo -u postgres dropdb loomio_development`

        RAILS_ENV=development rake db:setup bootstrap:create_user[user@email.com,userpasswd]

{: .note}
>
> Before you can setup a production database, you need to run through 'Setup Production ENV file' in the 'Production Environment Additional Settings' section at the bottom of this guide.

## Gulp

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used to buildl the frontend assets. The `gulp compile` task will build everything into public/client/development Run `gulp compile` after making changes or use `gulp dev` to show real time changes during development.  [Learn more about Loomio Gulp tasks](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/blob/master/angular/README.md)

        cd angular && gulp compile && cd ../

## Start Loomio in Ruby Rails Server

Rails server uses port 3000 by default  `netstat -a|grep 3000` will check the port is available. If you need to run rails server with an alternative port skip to the next steps. 
The `-e` option is used to set the environment development/test/production. This is run from Loomio root.

        bundle exec rails s -e development

Loomio should now be running [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) login with the username and password you created in step 3 of the 'Build Loomio Database' section.

### Start Rails Server With Alternative Port

1.  Amend the required Loomio environment file with your desired port `CANONICAL_PORT=8080` 

        nano .env.development

2.  Start rails server with alternative port option

        bundle exec rails s -p 8080 -e development

{: .note}
>
> Use the PiD file option if you want to run two environments at the same time `s -p 8888 -e test -P /tmp/pids/alternate_server.pid` 

## Give Loomio User Admin Privileges

1.  From Loomio root directory enter the `rails console`

        bundle exec rails console development

For production environment use Heroku. See 'Production Environment Additional Setup' section below.

        heroku local:run bundle exec rails console

2.  Run the following console commands, replacing the email with your Loomio user login.

        u = User.find_by email: 'user@email.com'
        u.is_admin = true
        u.save
        exit

Admin options will now be available at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) here you can add override styles (css) and change logos.

## Start Loomio with PM2 Process Manager

The [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) Node package can also be used to start Ruby packages at boot.

1.  Install PM2 Globally. Stop Loomio with **CTRL+C** if it's running from terminal.

        npm install pm2 -g

2.  Run PM2 start process. Add `-p 8080` option before `-e development` if you're using an alternative port, set -e option to your required environment (development/test). Replace `~/loomio` with your loomio root path.

        pm2 start ~/loomio/script/rails --name "loomio-dev" --interpreter=ruby -- s -e development

###  PM2 Production

Starting Loomio with Heroku in production environment requires changing to Loomio root for the current working directory (CWD). PM2 only supports this from its [startup process files](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/)

1.  Create a Json process file and update with the path to your loomio root. *The 'watch' option tells PM2 to restart if a Loomio file changes.*

        nano pm2loomio.json
```
{
  "name" : "Loomio-Heroku",
  "script" : "heroku",
  "watch" : true,
  "cwd" : "/home/boardmark/loomio",
  "args" : "local"
}
```

2.  Run PM2 start process file.

        pm2 start pm2loomio.json

### Create PM2 init startup. 

This will make PM2 processes start at boot.

        pm2 startup

## Production Environment Additional Setup

For the production environment we will be using Heroku Local, this will use Ruby Puma web server. For Loomio to function properly it will require SMTP. It's also recommended that you use TLS/SSL which can be achieved with Letsencrypt. You may also want to [Secure Rails](https://github.com/ankane/secure_rails)

{: .note}
>
> Secure information stored in config/database.yml and .env will be ignored by Git in .gitignore this should be updated if you change where secure information is stored.

### Install Heroku Local

Add Heroku repository and install it. [More about Heroku Local here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local)

        curl -L https://cli-assets.heroku.com/apt/release.key | sudo apt-key add -
        echo "deb https://cli-assets.heroku.com/branches/stable/apt ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/heroku.list
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install heroku

### Setup Production ENV file.

1.  Create production ENV file in your Loomio root directory, these are hidden files. NOTE: The next series of steps assumes that Loomio root is your working directory. e.g `cd ~/loomio`

        nano .env

2.  Use the following default environment settings to add and amend to your production .env file.

```txt
# this is the hostname of your app used by loomio
CANONICAL_HOST=REPLACE_WITH_HOSTNAME
CANONICAL_PORT=REPLACE_WITH_PORT

# the number of dots in your hostname
TLD_LENGTH=REPLACE_WITH_TLD_LENGTH

# smtp settings
SUPPORT_EMAIL=REPLACE_WITH_CONTACT_EMAIL
SMTP_DOMAIN=REPLACE_WITH_HOSTNAME

SMTP_SERVER=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USERNAME=smtpusername
SMTP_PASSWORD=smtppassword

# helper bot is the account which welcomes people to there groups.
HELPER_BOT_EMAIL=no-reply@REPLACE_WITH_HOSTNAME
RAILS_ENV=production
FORCE_SSL=1

# Secret key info, this will be generated in a later step
```

3.  Generate and add secret key security to .env. 

```
echo DEVISE_SECRET=`openssl rand -base64 48` >> .env && \
echo SECRET_COOKIE_TOKEN=`openssl rand -base64 48` >> .env
```
### Build Production Database

Make sure you have entered production database connection details into config/database.yml. Here we use Heroku Local to invoke Rake. Heroku will use the .env environment file by default. You can use the -e option if you want to use an alternative .env file or location. `heroku local:run -e .env.production` remember to update .gitignore if you do.

        heroku local:run rake db:setup bootstrap:create_user[user@email.com,userpasswd]

### Install Loomio Plugins

Loomio plugins are available as separate repositories on [github.com/loomio](https://github.com/loomio/) to see the default plugins use `cat config/plugins.yml`

1.  We don't want all of the default plugins so we will create a custom plugins yaml file.

        nano config/plugins.custom.yml
```
loomio_webhooks:
  repo:         loomio/loomio_webhooks

loomio_tags:
  repo:         loomio/loomio_tags

loomio_content_preview:
  repo:         loomio/loomio_content_preview
```

2.  Fetch and install plugins.

        rake 'plugins:fetch[plugins.custom]' plugins:install

### Copy Gulp Compiled Assets

If you've made changes or haven't run gulp compile, do so now `cd angular && gulp compile && cd ../` This will copy the compiled assets to a Loomio current version directory.

        cp -r public/client/development public/client/`ruby -r "./lib/version.rb" -e "puts Loomio::Version.current"

### Precompile Controller Assets

In production environment controller assets need to be precompiled.  [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.0/asset_pipeline.html#precompiling-assets](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.0/asset_pipeline.html#precompiling-assets) 
To remove precompiled assets run `rake assets:clobber`

        rake assets:precompile

### Cron Tasks

This assumes you have crontab installed and have set it to use the default editor of your choice.

        crontab -e

Add the following to run hourly tasks on Loomio production. You can see see more about what these tasks are and other tasks that may need to be run [here](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/blob/master/lib/tasks/loomio.rake) Replace `~/loomio` with your loomio root path.

        0 * * * *  cd ~/loomio && heroku local:run rake loomio:hourly_tasks
