Dokku is a self-hosted Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that makes deploying applications simple using Git. Although Dokku's implementation is similar to Heroku, it lacks certain key features such as auto-scaling. Dokku is an extremely powerful tool that automatically runs your application inside Docker and requires minimal configuration of web servers.

This guide demonstrates how to:

 - Create a Flask application that returns 'Hello World!' on the index page
 - Install Dokku on a Linode
 - Deploy a Flask application with a WSGI server inside a Docker container
 - Add an SSL certificate through Dokku with the Let's Encrypt plugin

## Before You Begin

### On Your Local Computer

A [public key](/docs/security/authentication/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) is assumed to be available. Typically this is located in `~/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

Install Git if needed:

    sudo apt install git

### On Your Linode

The Dokku install script creates a `dokku` user on the system, installs Docker, and pulls the relevant image.

1.  Download the install script from Dokku then run the script:

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku/dokku/v0.11.6/bootstrap.sh
        sudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.11.6 bash bootstrap.sh

    {{< output >}}
Preparing to install v0.11.6 from https://github.com/dokku/dokku.git...
For dokku to build containers, it is strongly suggested that you have 1024 megabytes or more of free memory
If necessary, please consult this document to setup swap: http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/advanced-installation/#vms-with-less-than-1gb-of-memory
--> Ensuring we have the proper dependencies
--> Initial apt-get update
--> Installing docker
--> NOTE: Using Linode? Docker may complain about missing AUFS support.
    You can safely ignore this warning.
        Installation will continue in 10 seconds.
...
{{< /output >}}

2.  Navigate to the public IP address of your Linode in a browser and enter the public key:

    ![Initial Dokku Installation](/docs/assets/dokku-public-key.png)

    {{< caution >}}
Add the public key immediately after running the installation script to avoid someone else adding a public key to Dokku. For an unattended installation, refer to the [advanced installation instructions](https://github.com/dokku/dokku/blob/master/docs/getting-started/advanced-installation.md).
{{< /caution >}}

3.  To add additional SSH keys, pipe the output over SSH to the `dokku` user. Replace `example.com` with the IP address of your Linode.

        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh dokku@example.com ssh-keys:add new-key

## Create a Flask Application

1.  On your local computer, create a new project directory:

        mkdir flask-example && cd flask-example

2.  Create a new file called `hello_world.py` that serves 'Hello World!' on the index page.

    {{< file "hello_world.py" python >}}
import os

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Bind to PORT if defined, otherwise default to 5000.
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=port)
{{< /file >}}

3.  Add a `requirements.txt` file to track versions of any dependencies of the Flask application. Gunicorn is the WSGI server used to allow Flask to interface properly with NGINX.

    {{< file "requirements.txt" >}}
Flask==0.12.1
gunicorn==19.7.1
{{< /file >}}

4.  For more complex projects with many dependencies using a virtual environment, redirect output of `pip freeze` into `requirements.txt`.

        pip freeze > requirements.txt

### Add a gitignore

Optionally, add a `.gitignore` file to have Git omit caching and virtual environment files from version control.

{{< file ".gitignore" >}}
__pycache__/
*.pyc

venv/
{{< /file >}}

### Procfile

The Procfile tells the Gunicorn server what command to use when launching the app:

{{< file "Procfile" >}}
web: gunicorn hello_world:app --workers=4
{{< /file >}}

{{< note >}}
4 workers is a good default for an web app running on a Linode. See the [Gunicorn docs](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/design.html#how-many-workers) for more information about determining the correct number of workers for your particular app.
{{< /note >}}

### Git Remote

1.  Initialize a Git repository:

        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "Deploy Flask with Dokku"

2.  Add a remote named `dokku` with the username `dokku` and substitute `example.com` with the public IP address of your Linode:

        git remote add dokku dokku@example.com:flask-example

3.  Verify the remote is added:

        git remote -v

    This will list the remotes.

    {{< output >}}
dokku   dokku@example-ip:flask-example (fetch)
dokku   dokku@example-ip:flask-example (push)
{{< /output >}}

    In summary, the project layout looks like:

        flask-example
        ├── .gitignore
        ├── Procfile
        ├── hello_world.py
        └── requirements.txt

## Create Project on a Dokku Host

1.  SSH into your Linode and create the application:

        dokku apps:create flask-example

2.  Make sure VHOST is enabled.

        dokku domains:enable flask-example

## Deploy a Flask Application

1.  On your local computer, deploy the Flask application by pushing the branch to the `dokku` remote. This will take care of NGINX behind the scenes and expose port `80`:

        git push dokku master

    Other local branches can also be deployed but, all branches must be pushed to the master branch of the `dokku` remote:

        git push dokku branch-name:master

2.  `curl` the IP address of your Linode to test that the app was deployed successfully:

        curl example.com

    {{< output >}}
Hello World!
{{< /output >}}

###  SSL Certificate with Dokku and Let's Encrypt

The remaining steps in this guide should be performed from your Linode.

1.  Install the Let's Encrypt plugin for Dokku:

        sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt.git

2.  Set the `DOKKU_LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` environment variable to the email for Let's Encrypt:

        dokku config:set flask-example DOKKU_LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=docs@linode.com

3.  Add the application and domain:

        dokku domains:add flask-example example.com

4.  Create the SSL certificate. NGINX will automatically start serving the application over HTTPS on port 443:

         dokku letsencrypt flask-example

5.  Run this as a cron job so the certificate will renew automatically:.

        dokku letsencrypt:cron-job --add

    {{< note >}}
This requires Dokku version 0.5 or higher. Check by running `dokku version`.
{{< /note >}}

## Start, Stop, and Restart Applications

* List all running Dokku applications:

        dokku apps

* Restart an application:

        dokku ps:restart flask-example

* Stop an application:

        dokku ps:stop flask-example

* Restore all applications after a reboot:

        dokku ps:restore

### View Application Logs

View the application logs through Dokku or the Docker container.

1.  To see logs through Dokku:

        dokku logs flask-example

2.  List all running Docker containers:

        sudo docker ps -a

3.  Find the container ID then run:

        sudo docker logs container_id

## Scale Applications

Dokku does not scale applications automatically, and by default will only run a single `web` process. To increase the number of containers running your application, you can use the `ps:scale` command.

1.  Check how many workers your application currently has:

        dokku ps:scale flask-example

    {{< output >}}
-----> Scaling for flask-example
-----> proctype           qty
-----> --------           ---
-----> web                1
{{< /output >}}

2.  Scale up to 4 `web` processes:

        dokku ps:scale flask-example web=4

3.  Confirm that the new processes are running:

    {{< output >}}
-----> Scaling for flask-example
-----> proctype           qty
-----> --------           ---
-----> web                4
{{< /output >}}

Dokku is an open source alternative to Heroku for small applications. Deploying applications is as simple as pushing to a remote with Git. Elements such as Docker and NGINX are abstracted away to minimize time to deployment. There are additional features such as [pre-deploy hooks](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/advanced-usage/deployment-tasks/) and linking databases which are not shown in this guide.
