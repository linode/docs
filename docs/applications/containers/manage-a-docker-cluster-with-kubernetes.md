![Manage a Docker Cluster with Kubernetes](/docs/assets/manage-a-docker-cluster-with-kubernetes/docker-cluster-kubernetes.jpg)

## What is a Kubernetes Cluster?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open source platform for managing containerized applications. If you use Docker for an application deployed on multiple Linodes, a Kubernetes cluster can manage your servers and deployments, including tasks such as scaling, deployment, and rolling upgrades.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of at least one master node and several worker nodes. The master node runs the API server, the scheduler and the controller manager, and the actual application is deployed dynamically across the cluster.

## System Requirements

To complete this guide you will need three Linodes running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, each with at least 4GB of RAM. Before beginning this guide, you should also use the Linode Manager to generate a [private IP address](https://linode.com/docs/networking/remote-access#adding-private-ip-addresses) for each Linode.

## Before You Begin

This article requires that you first complete our [How to Install, Configure, and Deploy NGINX on a Kubernetes Cluster](https://linode.com/docs/applications/containers/how-to-deploy-nginx-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/) guide and follow the procedures described there to configure one master node and two worker nodes.

Set the hostnames of the three Linodes as follows:

* Master node: `kube-master`
* First worker node: `kube-worker-1`
* Second worker node: `kube-worker-2`

Unless otherwise stated, all commands will be executed from the `kube-master`.

## Kubernetes Pods

A [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/) is a group of one or more tightly coupled containers that share resources such as storage and network. Containers inside a pod are started, stopped, and replicated as a group.

### Create a Deployment

[Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) are high-level objects that can manage pod creation and allow the use of features such as declarative scaling and rolling-upgrade.

1.  In a text editor, create `nginx.yaml` and add the following content:

    {{< file "~/nginx.yaml" yaml >}}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.13-alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
{{< /file >}}

    The file contains all the necessary information to specify a deployment, including the Docker image to use, number of replicas, and the container port. For more information about deployment configuration, see the [documentation.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#creating-a-deployment)

2.  Create your first deployment:

        kubectl create -f nginx.yaml --record

3.  List your deployments:

        kubectl get deployments

    ```
    NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx-server   1         1         1            1           13s
    ```

4.  Check that your pod is present:

        kubectl get pods

    ```
    NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-d2gqv   1/1       Running   0          58s
    ```

5.  To see which node the deployment was created on, add the `-o wide` flag:

        kubectl get pods -o wide

    ```
    NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP                NODE
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-d2gqv   1/1       Running   0          1m        192.168.255.197   kube-worker-02
    ```

### Scale Deployments

Kubernetes makes it easy to scale deployments to add or remove replicas.

1.  Increase the number of replicas to 8:

        kubectl scale deployment nginx-server --replicas=8

2.  Check the availability of your new replicas:

        kubectl get pods -o wide

    ```
  NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP               NODE
  nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-4mdf6   1/1       Running   0          41s       192.168.180.10   kube-worker-1
  nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-8mvrd   1/1       Running   0          3m        192.168.180.9    kube-worker-1
  nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-b99pt   1/1       Running   0          40s       192.168.180.12   kube-worker-1
  nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-fjg2c   1/1       Running   0          40s       192.168.127.12   kube-worker-2
  nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-kgdq5   1/1       Running   0          41s       192.168.127.11   kube-worker-2
  nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-mhb7s   1/1       Running   0          40s       192.168.180.11   kube-worker-1
  nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-rlf9w   1/1       Running   0          41s       192.168.127.10   kube-worker-2
  nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-scwgj   1/1       Running   0          40s       192.168.127.13   kube-worker-2
    ```

3.  The same command can be used to decrease the number of replicas:

        kubectl scale deployment nginx-server --replicas=3

### Rolling Upgrades

Managing pods with a Deployment allows you to make use of **rolling upgrades**. A rolling upgrade is a mechanism that allows you to update your application version without any downtime. Kubernetes ensures that at least 25% of your Pods are available at all times and creates new pods before deleting the old ones.

1.  Upgrade your containers' NGINX version from 1.13 to 1.13.8:

        kubectl set image deployment/nginx-server nginx=nginx:1.13.8-alpine

    Similar to the scaling process, the `set` command uses declarative approach: you specify the desired state and the controller manages all necessary tasks to accomplish that goal.

2.  Check the update status:

        kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-server

    ```
Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
deployment "nginx-server" successfully rolled out
    ```

3.  You can manually check the application version with the `describe` command:

        kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

4.  In the event of an error, the rollout will hang and you will be forced to cancel by pressing **CTRL+C**. Test this by setting an invalid NGINX version:

        kubectl set image deployment/nginx-server nginx=nginx:1.18.

5.  Check your current pods:

        kubectl get pods -o wide

    ```
NAME                            READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE       IP               NODE
nginx-server-76976d4555-7nv6z   1/1       Running            0          3m        192.168.127.15   kube-worker-2
nginx-server-76976d4555-wg785   1/1       Running            0          3m        192.168.180.13   kube-worker-1
nginx-server-76976d4555-ws4vf   1/1       Running            0          3m        192.168.127.14   kube-worker-2
nginx-server-7ddd985dd6-mpn9h   0/1       ImagePullBackOff   0          2m        192.168.180.16   kube-worker-1
    ```

    The pod `nginx-server-7ddd985dd6-mpn9h` is trying to upgrade to an nonexistent version of NGINX.

6.  Get more details about the error by inspecting this pod:

        kubectl describe pod nginx-server-7ddd985dd6-mpn9h

7.  Since you used the `--record` flag when creating the deployment, you can retrieve the complete revision history:

        kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-server

    ```
    REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
    1         kubectl scale deployment nginx-server --replicas=3
    2         kubectl set image deployment/nginx-server nginx=nginx:1.13.8-alpine
    3         kubectl set image deployment/nginx-server nginx=nginx:1.18
    ```

8.  You can then roll back to an earlier, working revision. To revert to the previous revision, use the `undo` command:

        kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-server

9.  To roll back to a specific revision, specify the target revision with the `--to-revision` option:

        kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-server --to-revision=1

## Kubernetes Services

You now have a deployment running three pods of an NGINX application. In order to expose the pods to the internet, you need to create a **service**. In Kubernetes a service is an abstraction that allows pods to be accessible at all times. Services automatically handle IP changes, updates, and scaling, so once the service is enabled your application will be available as long as a running pod remains active.

1.  Configure a test service:

    {{< file "~/nginx-service.yaml" conf >}}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
  labels:
    run: nginx
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
  selector:
    app: nginx
{{< /file >}}

2.  Create the service:

        kubectl create -f nginx-service.yaml

3.  Check the status of the new service:

        kubectl get services

    ```
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.96.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        2d
nginx-service   NodePort    10.97.41.31   <none>        80:31738/TCP   38m
    ```

    The service is running and accepting connections on port 31738.

4.  Test the service:

        curl <MASTER_LINODE_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT(S)>

5.  View additional information about this service with the `describe` command:

        kubectl describe service nginx-service

    ```
Name:                     nginx-service
Namespace:                default
Labels:                   run=nginx
Annotations:              <none>
Selector:                 app=nginx
Type:                     NodePort
IP:                       10.97.41.31
Port:                     http  80/TCP
TargetPort:               80/TCP
NodePort:                 http  31738/TCP
Endpoints:                192.168.127.14:80,192.168.127.15:80,192.168.180.13:80
Session Affinity:         None
External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
Events:                   <none>
    ```

## Kubernetes Namespaces

Namespaces are logical environments that offer the flexibility to divide Cluster resources between multiple teams or users.

1.  List the available namespaces:

        kubectl get namespaces

    ```
default       Active        7h
kube-public   Active        7h
kube-system   Active        7h
    ```

    As the name implies, the `default` namespace is where your deployments will be placed if no other namespace is specified. `kube-system` is reserved for objects created by Kubernetes and `kube-public` is available for all users. Namespaces can be created from a `.json` file or directly from the command line.

2.  Create a new file named `dev-namespace.json` for the **Development** environment:

    {{< file "~/home/dev-namespace.json" conf >}}
{
  "kind": "Namespace",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "development",
    "labels": {
      "name": "development"
    }
  }
}
{{< /file >}}

3.  Create the namespace in your cluster:

        kubectl create -f dev-namespace.json

4.  List the namespaces again:

        kubectl get namespaces

### Contexts

In order to use your namespaces you need to define the **context** where you want to employ them. Kubernetes contexts are saved in the `kubectl` configuration.

1.  View your current configuration:

        kubectl config view

2.  Check in what context you are working on:

        kubectl config current-context

3.  Add the `dev` context using the command:

        kubectl config set-context dev --namespace=development \
        --cluster=kubernetes \
        --user=kubernetes-admin

4.  Switch to the `dev` context/namespace:

        kubectl config use-context dev

5.  Verify the change:

        kubectl config current-context

6.  Review your new configuration:

        kubectl config view

7.  Pods within a namespace are not visible to other namespaces. Check this by listing your pods:

        kubectl get pods

    The message "No resources found" appears because you have no pods or deployments created in this namespace. You still can view these objects with the `--all-namespaces` flag:

        kubectl get services --all-namespaces

### Labels

Any object in Kubernetes can have a label attached to it. Labels are key value pairs that make it easier to organize, filter, and select objects based on common characteristics.

1.  Create a test deployment for this namespace. This deployment will include the `nginx` label:

    {{< file "~/my-app.yaml" yaml >}}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.12-alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
{{< /file >}}

2.  Create the deployment:

        kubectl create -f my-app.yaml --record

3.  If you need to find a particular pod within your cluster, rather than listing all of the pods it is usually more efficient to search by label with the `-l` option:

        kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app=nginx

    Only the pods in the `default` and `development` namespace are listed because they have the label `nginx` included in their definition.

## Kubernetes Nodes

A node may be a physical machine or a virtual machine. In this guide each Linode is a node. Think of nodes as the uppermost level in the Kubernetes abstraction model.

1.  List your current nodes:

        kubectl get nodes

    ```
NAME             STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
kube-master      Ready     master    21h       v1.9.2
kube-worker-1    Ready     <none>    19h       v1.9.2
kube-worker-2    Ready     <none>    17h       v1.9.2
    ```

2.  For more detail, add the `-o` flag:

        kubectl get nodes -o wide

3.  The information displayed is mostly self-explanatory and useful for checking that all nodes are ready. You can also use the `describe` command for more detailed information about a specific node:

        kubectl describe node kube-worker-1

### Node Maintenance

Kubernetes offers a very straightforward solution for taking nodes offline safely.

1.  Return to the default namespace where you have a running service for NGINX:

        kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes

2.  Check your pods:

        kubectl get pods -o wide

3.  Prevent new pods creation on the node `kube-worker-2`:

        kubectl cordon kube-worker-2

4.  Check the status of your nodes:

        kubectl get nodes

    ```
NAME             STATUS                     ROLES     AGE       VERSION
kube-master      Ready                      master    4h        v1.9.2
kube-worker-1    Ready                      <none>    4h        v1.9.2
kube-worker-2    Ready,SchedulingDisabled   <none>    4h        v1.9.2
    ```

5.  To test the Kubernetes controller and scheduler, scale up your deployment:

        kubectl scale deployment nginx-server --replicas=10

6.  List your pods again:

        kubectl get pods -o wide

    ```
    NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP                NODE
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-2pnbk   1/1       Running   0          11s       192.168.188.146   kube-worker-1
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-4cls5   1/1       Running   0          11s       192.168.188.148   kube-worker-1
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-7nw5m   1/1       Running   0          3d        192.168.255.220   kube-worker-2
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-7s7w5   1/1       Running   0          44s       192.168.188.143   kube-worker-1
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-88dvp   1/1       Running   0          11s       192.168.188.145   kube-worker-1
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-95jgr   1/1       Running   0          3d        192.168.255.221   kube-worker-2
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-md4qd   1/1       Running   0          3d        192.168.188.139   kube-worker-1
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-r5krq   1/1       Running   0          11s       192.168.188.144   kube-worker-1
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-r5nd6   1/1       Running   0          44s       192.168.188.142   kube-worker-1
    nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-ztgmr   1/1       Running   0          11s       192.168.188.147   kube-worker-1
    ```

    There are ten pods in total but new pods were created only in the first node.

7.  Tell `kube-worker-2` to drain its running pods:

        kubectl drain kube-worker-2 --ignore-daemonsets

    ```
    node "kube-worker-2" already cordoned
    WARNING: Ignoring DaemonSet-managed pods: calico-node-9mgc6, kube-proxy-2v8rw
    pod "my-app-68845b9f68-wcqsb" evicted
    pod "nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-7nw5m" evicted
    pod "nginx-server-b9bc6c6b5-95jgr" evicted
    pod "my-app-68845b9f68-n5kpt" evicted
    node "kube-worker-2" drained
    ```

8.  Check the effect of this command on your pods:

        kubectl get pods -o wide

    ```
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP                NODE
