In this guide, you'll install Docker and pull down images that can be deployed as containers.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  Update your system (this example uses Ubuntu 16.04):

        apt update && apt upgrade

{: .note}
> The steps in this guide require root privileges. Be sure to run the steps below as `root` or with the `sudo` prefix. For more information on privileges, see our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Install Docker

1.  As of this writing, the recommended Docker installation is Docker CE. Remove any older installations of Docker that may be on your system:

        apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io

2.  Make sure you have the necessary packages to allow the use of Docker's repository:

        apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

3.  Add Docker's GPG key:

        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

4.  Verify the fingerprint of the GPG key:

        apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

    You should see output similar to the following:

    {:.output}
    ~~~
    pub   4096R/0EBFCD88 2017-02-22
          Key fingerprint = 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
    uid                  Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
    sub   4096R/F273FCD8 2017-02-22
    ~~~

5.  Add the `stable` Docker repository:

        add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

6.  Update your package index and install Docker CE:

        apt update
        apt install docker-ce

7.  Add your limited user account to the `docker` group:

        usermod -aG docker exampleuser

    You will need to restart your shell session for this change to take effect.

8.  Check that the installation was successful by running the built-in "Hello World" program:

        docker run hello-world


## Start and Enable Docker

Start and enable the Docker process to run on boot:

    systemctl start docker
    systemctl enable docker

## Pull Docker Images

The first thing you are going to want to do is pull down an image to be used as the basis for your Docker containers. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the default registry from which to pull images.

1.  Use the `images` command to check what images already exist on your Linode. This example shows that no images are installed:

        docker images

    ![List Docker Images](/docs/assets/docker/docker-install-images-list.jpg "List Docker Images")

2. Pull the [nginx web server](https://nginx.org/en/), using the `docker pull` command:

        docker pull nginx

    This will pull the latest official nginx Docker image

    ![Pull Official nginx Image](/docs/assets/docker/docker-install-image-nginx.jpg "Pull the official nginx image")

3.  If you run `docker images` again, you'll see the nginx image:

    ![docker images Shows the nginx Image](/docs/assets/docker/docker-install-image-nginx-installed.jpg "docker images now shows the nginx image")

### Find Unofficial nginx Images

Alternatively, if you don't want to install the official nginx image, use `docker search` to find other nginx images:

    docker search nginx

This command will list all variant images, along with a respective description, and whether or not they are official.

![Run docker search nginx to Show Other nginx Options](/docs/assets/docker/docker-install-image-nginx-options.jpg "Run docker search nginx to Show Other nginx Options")

Use `docker pull` to pull one of the other images:

    docker pull blacklabelops/nginx

## Ready to Keep Going?

At this point, you should know how to install Docker and pull down images with which you can then deploy containers. Use `man docker` to dive into the manual or visit our other [Docker Guides](/docs/applications/containers/) to learn more.
