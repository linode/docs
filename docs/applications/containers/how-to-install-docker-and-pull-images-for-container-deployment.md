![How to Install Docker and Pull Images for Container Deployment](/docs/assets/install_docker.jpg)

In this guide, you'll install Docker and pull down images that can be deployed as containers.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  Update your system (this example uses Ubuntu 16.04):

        apt update && apt upgrade

{{< note >}}
The steps in this guide require root privileges. Be sure to run the steps below as `root` or with the `sudo` prefix. For more information on privileges, see our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## Install Docker

{{< content "install_docker_ce.md" >}}

## Start and Enable Docker

Start and enable the Docker process to run on boot:

    systemctl start docker
    systemctl enable docker

## Pull Docker Images

The first thing you are going to want to do is pull down an image to be used as the basis for your Docker containers. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the default registry from which to pull images.

1.  Use the `images` command to check what images already exist on your Linode. This example shows that no images are installed:

        docker images

    ![List Docker Images](/docs/assets/docker/docker-install-images-list.jpg "List Docker Images")

2. Pull the [nginx web server](https://nginx.org/en/), using the `docker pull` command:

        docker pull nginx

    This will pull the latest official nginx Docker image

    ![Pull Official nginx Image](/docs/assets/docker/docker-install-image-nginx.jpg "Pull the official nginx image")

3.  If you run `docker images` again, you'll see the nginx image:

    ![docker images Shows the nginx Image](/docs/assets/docker/docker-install-image-nginx-installed.jpg "docker images now shows the nginx image")

### Find Unofficial nginx Images

Alternatively, if you don't want to install the official nginx image, use `docker search` to find other nginx images:

    docker search nginx

This command will list all variant images, along with a respective description, and whether or not they are official.

![Run docker search nginx to Show Other nginx Options](/docs/assets/docker/docker-install-image-nginx-options.jpg "Run docker search nginx to Show Other nginx Options")

Use `docker pull` to pull one of the other images:

    docker pull blacklabelops/nginx

## Ready to Keep Going?

At this point, you should know how to install Docker and pull down images with which you can then deploy containers. Use `man docker` to dive into the manual or visit our other [Docker Guides](/docs/applications/containers/) to learn more.
