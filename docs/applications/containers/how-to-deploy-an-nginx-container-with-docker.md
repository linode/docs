![How to Deploy Docker Containers](/docs/assets/docker/deploy_docker_container.jpg)


## What is a Docker Container?

According to Docker.com, a container is a "lightweight, stand-alone, executable piece of a software package that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings." A containers isolates software from its surroundings and is created from the images pulled from a Docker registry. For example, you can pull the nginx image and create as many containers from it as needed.

## Docker Command Syntax

Deploy a Docker container using the following syntax:

    docker run â€“name CONTAINER-NAME -p NETWORK_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT IMAGE NAME

It consists of:

*  `CONTAINER-NAME`: The name you give the container.
*  `NETWORK_PORT`: A port available to the network.
*  `CONTAINER_PORT`: The port the container will listen on.
*  `IMAGE NAME`: The name of the image to be used for the container.

## Deploy a Container

This example will create an nginx container with port 80 exposed, using the official nginx image.

1.  Confirm the current, existing official image:

        docker images

    In this screenshot, the nginx image is two weeks old:

    ![DockerContainerImages](/docs/assets/docker/docker_container_images.png)

2.  Update the original image with `docker pull nginx` as shown in the [How to Install Docker and Pull Images for Container Deployment](/docs/applications/containers/how-to-install-docker-and-pull-images-for-container-deployment) guide. Run `docker image` again to confirm the update:

    ![Docker Pull New nginx Image](/docs/assets/docker/docker_container_pull_new_image.png "Pull newest nginx image and confirm version number.")

3.  Deploy the container:

        docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d nginx

    This will show the newly created ID for the container. Note that the `-d`, *detach*, option returns you to the prompt:

    ![Docker run](/docs/assets/docker/docker_container_run_container.png "Docker run returns the container ID.")

4.  Confirm that the container is running:

        docker ps -a

5.  Navigate to your Linode's IP address to see the default nginx welcome message:

    ![Welcome to nginx](/docs/assets/docker/docker_container_welcome_to_nginx.png "Welcome to nginx.")

## How to Stop and Delete Containers

1.  Stop the container by using the first few characters of the container ID (`e468` in this example):

        docker stop e468

2.  Delete the container by using the `rm` command and the same container ID:

        docker rm e468
