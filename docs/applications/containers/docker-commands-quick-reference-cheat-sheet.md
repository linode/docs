title: A Docker Commands Quick Reference Cheat Sheet
---
Docker is becoming increasingly popular among software developers, operators and enterprises as a software container platform. Containers package software in a format that can run isolated on a shared operating system. Bundled with only essential libraries and settings, Docker renders lightweight, efficient self-contained systems that run identically wherever deployed.

Optimizing the platform's functionality begins with mastery of requisite Docker commands, especially those listed on this cheat sheet that address installation, Hub interaction, and container and image creation and use.


##Installation
