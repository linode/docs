Docker is becoming increasingly popular among software developers, operators and enterprises as a software container platform. Containers package software in a format that can run isolated on a host operating system. Bundled with only essential libraries and settings, Docker renders lightweight, efficient, self-contained systems that run identically wherever deployed.

Optimizing the platform's functionality begins with mastery of the core Docker commands. This cheat sheet is a reference for the most basic Docker commands that address installation, Hub interaction, and working with containers and images.

As of this writing, the recommended Docker installation is Docker Community Edition ([Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)). See the official docs or our [How to Install Docker](/docs/applications/containers/how-to-install-docker-and-pull-images-for-container-deployment/) guide for more details.

{{< note >}}
If you have not added your limited user account to the `docker` group (with `sudo usermod -aG docker username`), all of the commands in this cheatsheet will need to be run with `sudo`.
