This guide will help you install Redmine on your Debian 6 (Squeeze) Linode. It is assumed that you've already followed the steps outlined in our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/). Please make sure you're logged into your Linode as root via an SSH session before proceeding. Throughout this guide, the example domain "example.com" is used. Please be sure to replace it with your own domain name wherever it is found.

# Set the Hostname

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started/#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

# Install Rails Packages and nginx with Phusion Passenger

Issue the following commands to update your local package database and install any outstanding updates.

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded

Issue the following command to install packages required for Ruby on Rails and other components.

    apt-get install wget build-essential ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev irb1.8 rdoc1.8 zlib1g-dev libpcre3-dev libopenssl-ruby1.8 libzlib-ruby libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libpq-dev postgresql subversion

Create symbolic links to the installed version of Ruby:

    ln -s /usr/bin/ruby1.8 /usr/bin/ruby
    ln -s /usr/bin/irb1.8 /usr/bin/irb

Fetch and install RubyGems version 1.5.3 by issuing the following commands:

    wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/74343/rubygems-1.5.3.tgz
    tar -xf rubygems*tgz
    cd rubygems*
    ruby setup.rb
    ln -s /usr/bin/gem1.8 /usr/bin/gem

Install some required gems:

    gem install -v=1.1.0 rack
    gem install fastthread
    gem install -v=2.3.5 rails
    gem install -v=0.4.2 i18n
    gem install postgres
    gem install pg

Proceed to the [Phusion Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/install.html) site and locate the link for the current source code tarball. Download it as follows (substitute the link for the current version):

    cd /opt
    wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/74471/passenger-3.0.5.tar.gz
    tar xzvf passenger*.gz

Run the Phusion Passenger installer for Nginx:

    cd passenger*/bin
    ./passenger-install-nginx-module

You'll be greeted by the Phusion Passenger nginx installer program. Press "Enter" to continue with the installation. When prompted for the Nginx installation method, it is recommended that you choose "1" to allow the installer to automatically download, compile, and install nginx for you. Unless you have specific needs that would necessitate passing custom options to nginx at compile time, this is the safest way to proceed. Please do **not** remove the Passenger files from `opt` after the install. They need to stay in place or your install will not function correctly.

Next, create the file `/etc/init.d/nginx` with the following contents:

{{< file "/etc/init.d/nginx" bash >}}
#!/bin/sh

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          nginx

          echo -n "Reloading $DESC configuration: "
          start-stop-daemon --stop --signal HUP --quiet --pidfile     /opt/nginx/logs/$NAME.pid \
              --exec $DAEMON
          echo "$NAME."
          ;;
      *)
            N=/etc/init.d/$NAME
            echo "Usage: $N {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload}" >&2
            exit 1
            ;;
esac
exit 0

{{< /file >}}


Issue the following commands the make the script executable and set it to start on boot:

    chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
    update-rc.d -f nginx defaults

# Optional: Proxy Redmine with Apache

If you're already running Apache on your Linode, you'll need to tell nginx to run on a different port and proxy requests for your Redmine installation back to it. If you're running another web server, you'll need to perform similar steps to modify its configuration to support this. This section is entirely optional, and only applies to Apache users.

Issue the following commands to enable proxy support:

    a2enmod proxy
    a2enmod proxy_http
    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Configure an Apache virtualhost for your Redmine installation. The example shown below assumes Apache is configured as recommended in our [Debian 6 LAMP guide](/docs/web-servers/lamp/lamp-server-on-debian-6-squeeze/). Remember to replace "12.34.56.78" with your Linode's IP address, `support@example.com` with your administrative email address, and "redmine.example.com" with your Redmine domain.

{{< file "/etc/apache2/sites-available/redmine.example.com" apache >}}
<VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerAdmin support@example.com
     ServerName redmine.example.com

     ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
     ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

     # Uncomment the line below if your site uses SSL.
     #SSLProxyEngine On
</VirtualHost>

{{< /file >}}


Issue the following commands to enable the site and reload Apache:

    a2ensite redmine.example.com
    /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Next, you'll need to tell nginx to run on a different port. Edit your nginx configuration file, setting the following value:

{{< file-excerpt "/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf" nginx >}}
listen 8080;

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


# Install and Configure Redmine

### Obtain Redmine

Check the [Redmine project site](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Download) to find the current version number for the stable branch. Issue the following commands to use `svn` to check out the code, replacing the URL on the last line with an updated URL if necessary.

    mkdir -p /srv/www/redmine.example.com
    cd /srv/www/redmine.example.com/
    svn co http://redmine.rubyforge.org/svn/branches/1.1-stable redmine-1.1
    mv redmine-1.1 redmine

You can use `svn up` from the `redmine` directory to keep it up to date in the future.

### Create and Configure the Database

Switch to the `postgres` user and start up the `psql` shell by issuing the following commands:

    su - postgres
    psql

Issue these commands in the `psql` shell to set up the database for Redmine. Be sure to specify a unique, strong password in place of "changeme".

    CREATE ROLE redmine LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'changeme' NOINHERIT VALID UNTIL 'infinity';
    CREATE DATABASE redmine WITH ENCODING='UTF8' OWNER=redmine TEMPLATE=template0;
    \q
    exit
    cd redmine

Create the file `config/database.yml` with the following contents, replacing "changeme" with the password you assigned in the last step.

{{< file "config/database.yml" yaml >}}
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: redmine
  host: localhost
  username: redmine
  password: changeme
  encoding: utf8
  schema_search_path: public

{{< /file >}}


Issue the following commands to complete database configuration:

    chmod 600 config/database.yml
    rake config/initializers/session_store.rb
    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
    RAILS_ENV=production rake redmine:load_default_data

If you receive an error message after issuing the `rake db:migrate` command, edit the `config/environment.rb` file to include the following excerpt between the bootstrap and initializer sections. After editing the file, retry the `rake db:migrate` command.

{{< file-excerpt "config/environment.rb" ruby >}}
if Gem::VERSION >= "1.3.6"
    module Rails
        class GemDependency
            def requirement
                r = super
                (r == Gem::Requirement.default) ? nil : r
            end
        end
    end
end

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


### Configure Email Service

Issue the following commands to install `exim4` and configure it for outgoing Internet email delivery. You can skip Exim installation if you already have an SMTP server configured that accepts unauthenticated locally sent mail, although you will still need to create Redmin's email configuration file as shown at the end of the section.

    apt-get install exim4
    dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config

Select "internet site" as the type of mail configuration to use:

[![Exim general configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/718-exim4-config-02.png)](/docs/assets/718-exim4-config-02.png)

Specify your system's fully qualified domain name as the system mail name:

[![Exim system mail name configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/719-exim4-config-03.png)](/docs/assets/719-exim4-config-03.png)

Enter "127.0.0.1" when asked for the IP address to listen on for SMTP connections. For purposes of allowing Redmine to send mail, you only want to listen on localhost.

[![Exim IP address configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/720-exim4-config-04.png)](/docs/assets/720-exim4-config-04.png)

Enter "localhost.localdomain" and your fully qualified domain name when asked for the list of recipient domains.

[![Exim destination domains configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/721-exim4-config-05.png)](/docs/assets/721-exim4-config-05.png)

Relay domains and machines should be left blank.

[![Exim relay domains configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/722-exim4-config-06.png)](/docs/assets/722-exim4-config-06.png)

[![Exim relay machines configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/723-exim4-config-07.png)](/docs/assets/723-exim4-config-07.png)

Specify "No" when asked about DNS queries.

[![Exim DNS queries configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/724-exim4-config-08.png)](/docs/assets/724-exim4-config-08.png)

When asked about maildirs versus mbox format, you may choose either. Maildirs are increasingly preferred by many modern mail tools.

[![Exim maildirs or mbox configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/725-exim4-config-09.png)](/docs/assets/725-exim4-config-09.png)

Specify "No" when asked whether to split the configuration into smaller files.

[![Exim config file splitting configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/726-exim4-config-10.png)](/docs/assets/726-exim4-config-10.png)

Enter "root" and an email address at your domain for the postmaster mail query.

[![Exim postmaster configuration on Debian 6.](/docs/assets/727-exim4-config-11.png)](/docs/assets/727-exim4-config-11.png)

Create the file `config/email.yml` and copy in the following contents. Be sure to replace the domain field with your fully qualified domain name.

{{< file "config/email.yml" yaml >}}
production:
  delivery_method: :smtp
  smtp_settings:
    address: 127.0.0.1
    port: 25
    domain: redmine.example.com
    authentication: :none

{{< /file >}}


This completes email configuration for your Redmine installation.

### Final Configuration and Testing

We'll create a "redmine" user to manage the installation. Issue the following commands to set ownership and permissions on your Redmine files, taking care to assign a unique, strong password for the Redmine user:

    adduser redmine
    cd /srv/www/redmine.example.com/
    chown -R redmine:redmine *
    cd redmine
    chmod -R 755 files log tmp public/plugin_assets

Edit the file `/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`, setting the "user" parameter to "redmine":

{{< file-excerpt "/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf" nginx >}}
user redmine;

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Add a server section after the first example server as follows. If you're proxying to nginx from another web server, be sure to change the `listen` directive to `listen 8080;` instead of the default. Be sure to replace "redmine.example.com" with the domain for your Redmine site.

{{< file-excerpt "/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf" nginx >}}
server {
     listen 80;
     server_name  redmine.example.com;
     root /srv/www/redmine.example.com/redmine/public/;
     access_log /srv/www/redmine.example.com/redmine/log/access.log;
     error_log /srv/www/redmine.example.com/redmine/log/error.log;
     index index.html;
     location / {
        passenger_enabled on;
        allow all;
     }
}

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Start nginx:

    /etc/init.d/nginx start

Your Redmine installation should be accessible at `http://redmine.example.com`; if you encounter issues, please refer to your log files for a listing of any errors that may have occurred. The default login is username "admin" and password "admin". You should change the admin password immediately. Congratulations, you've installed Redmine for project management on your Linode!
