	sudo mysql -u orangescrum -porangescrum < database.sql

8. Next, By default `STRICT mode` is `On` in Mysql. So you need to disable it.

You can do this by editing `my.cnf` file:

{: .file-excerpt}
/etc/mysql/my.cnf
:       ~~~ ini
	sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES
        ~~~


Save and close the file, restart mysql to reflect changes.

	</Directory>
        ~~~

2. When you are finished, It is recommended to check the configuration for syntax.

/var/www/html/orangescrumPM/app/Config/database.php
:       ~~~ ini
	class DATABASE_CONFIG {

        	public $default = array(
                	'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
	                'persistent' => false,
        	        'host' => 'localhost',
                	'login' => 'orangescrum',
	                'password' => 'orangescrum',
        	        'database' => 'orangescrum',
                	'prefix' => '',
	                'encoding' => 'utf8',
        	);
	}
        ~~~

Save and close the file, when you are finished.

2. Next, you need to provide your valid Gmail ID and Password for SMTP email sending and update the FROM_EMAIL_NOTIFY and SUPPORT_EMAIL.

You can do this by editing `constants.php` file:


{: .file-excerpt}
/var/www/html/orangescrumPM/app/Config/constants.php
:       ~~~ ini
	//Gmail SMTP
	define("SMTP_HOST", "ssl://smtp.gmail.com");
	define("SMTP_PORT", "465");
	define("SMTP_UNAME", "user@gmail.com");
	define("SMTP_PWORD", "**********");

	define('FROM_EMAIL_NOTIFY', 'user@gmail.com'); //(REQUIRED)
