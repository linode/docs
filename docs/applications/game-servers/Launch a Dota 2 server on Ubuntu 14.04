[Dota2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570) (Dota2) is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players. In this guide We'll Help you setup SteamCMD, We'll setup the Dota2 Dedicated Server over Ubuntu.

## Before You Begin

1.  You will need a [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com) account and a copy of [Dota2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/).

2.  Complete our guide: [Install SteamCMD for a Steam Game Server](/docs/applications/game-servers/install-steamcmd-for-a-steam-game-server). This will get SteamCMD installed and running on your Linode and this guide will pick up where the SteamCMD page leaves off.

>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Install Dota 2

1.  Be sure you are in the directory `~/Steam`, then access the `Steam>` prompt.

        cd ~/Steam && ./steamcmd.sh

2.  From the SteamCMD prompt, login anonymously:

        login anonymous

    Or log in with your Steam username:

        login user_name

3.  Install Dota2 to the `Steam` user's home directory:

        force_install_dir ./dota2_gameserver
        app_update 570 validate

    This can take some time. If the download looks as if it has frozen, be patient. Once the download is complete, you should see this output:

        Success! App '570' fully installed.

        Steam>

4.  Exit SteamCMD.

        quit

    >To update Dota 2, run the above 4 commands again.

## Configure the Server

 Now, Lets install MetaMod for Dota-2 to Run Properly.
    1. Go into Dota 2 Directory

        cd ~/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota

    2. Download the source and extract it:

        wget http://www.metamodsource.net/mmsdrop/1.10/mmsource-1.10.7-git952-linux.tar.gz
        tar -xvf mmsource-1.10.7-git952-linux.tar.gz

    3. As Dota 2 requires a program called srcds to run properly, we'll grab that now:

        wget -O srcds.tar.gz https://forums.alliedmods.net/attachment.php?attachmentid=140208&d=1416970992
        cd ~/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota
        tar -xvf srcds.tar.gz



## Start the Server

Create a `screen session` and start the server inside of it.
        screen -dmS dota2server "/home/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/srcds_run -game dota -console"

    You can put that in `/etc/rc.local` to have your Dota 2 server start when your instance boots up. Do that by opening it ( nano /etc/rc.local ), paste the command above and save the file.
