title: Looks like you're trying to find a deprecated guide
---

We keep our deprecated guides [on our GitHub](https://github.com/linode/docs/tree/master/docs), but they aren't maintained.

If you followed a link here from another guide, we'll see this in the logs, and we'll fix it soon.

## Contribute a Fix or Update

If you're using an older guide to work on something new, consider documenting the process and submitting it to our library. If we accept it, we'll pay you for your work.

Go to [our Contribute page](/docs/contribute) to learn more and to submit your guide.
