##Introduction

Today, in a world where online servers are constantly being attacked and confidential data is being stolen, it is reasonable to be worried that "Is my server safe from such attacks ?". This guide address these questions and also details step-by-step methods to patch the vulnerabilities to create the safest possible server configuration.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will **not** use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do **not** follow the Configure a Firewall section yet--this guide includes firewall rules specifically for a dedicated web server.

3.  Update your system.

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

{: .note}
>
>This guide is written for a root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are **not** prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

4.	Before starting any configuration review, it is important to understand what the system is used for. The exposure and security requirements will differ based on system purpose, for example, a web server on the Internet and a database server in your internal network have totally different security models. Here, for convenience, the system is a web server available on Internet and it is used to serve a PHP web application (a Wordpress blog). Nothing else is used or needed on this system.

This system is supposed to be available on Internet, it is therefore likely to be attacked remotely and will almost certainly have brute-force attacks performed against it.

## System Review

### Kernel

1.	The Kernel version can be retrieved by using the command uname
	uname -a

Based on this version information, you need to identify whether any vulnerabilities have been published for this specific version. Make sure that you are checking this version against the distribution vulnerabilities list, as most Linux distributions back-port patches without changing the kernel major and minor version.

Checking the uptime of a Linux system can also be a good indicator on when the last kernel upgrade was performed:

	uptime

The kernel is unlikely to have been patched since the last time it was started.

### Time Management

It is really important that a system is correctly synchronised with a NTP server. It is important for all operations based on the time:

1.	Logs management;
2. SSL verification of certificates;
3. Authentication based on the time.
Furthermore, for sensitive production systems it is always better to use a timezone that doesn't present daylight savings to avoid time jump in the logs. Time jumps are bad as they prevent the accurate correlation between multiple log sources.

	cat /etc/timezone

Another thing is to use a NTP server instead of setting the time manually using 'ntpdate':

	ntpdate

the time will stay synchronised;
there is no risk of a time jump occuring in the logs.

Here, we can see that a NTP server is running:

	# ps -edf | grep ntp
	ntp       1397     1  0 02:21 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/ntpd -p /var/run/ntpd.pid -g -u 102:104

We however need to check that the NTP server can access the servers it is trying to connect to:

	# ntpq  -p -n
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
	==============================================================================
    -121.0.0.41      204.152.184.72   2 u  250 1024  377   54.635   -2.797   0.877
	+203.26.72.7     202.147.104.51   3 u  393 1024  377   58.965   -0.952   9.207
	*130.102.128.23  130.102.132.164  2 u  495 1024  377   59.171    0.984   2.292
	+208.87.107.28   206.246.122.250  2 u  461 1024  377  272.890    1.948   1.136

Here, it can correctly access its peers.

NTP can also use keys for servers authentication in extremely sensitive environments.

### Packages Installed

It is always a good thing to check that the number of packages is limited to the strict minimum to limit the system exposure. Furthermore, since the audited system is used as a web server, some packages, such as those related to the graphical interface (X, Gnome, KDE) or games are not needed and should not be installed.

On Debian, you can retrieve a list of packages installed using the following command:

	# dpkg -l | less
	Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold
	| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend
	|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)
	||/ Name                                Version                      Description
	+++-===================================-============================-===================================================================
	ii  adduser                             3.112+nmu2                   add and remove users and groups
	ii  apache2                             2.2.16-6+squeeze7            Apache HTTP Server metapackage
	ii  apache2-mpm-prefork                 2.2.16-6+squeeze7            Apache HTTP Server - traditional non-threaded model
	ii  apache2-utils                       2.2.16-6+squeeze7            utility programs for webservers
	ii  apache2.2-bin                       2.2.16-6+squeeze7            Apache HTTP Server common binary files

You can then search this list for unneeded packages or packages presenting vulnerabilities.

### Logging

Another thing that needs to be checked is how the logging of events is performed. On this system, we can see that rsyslog is used:

	# ps -edf | grep syslog
	root      1305     1  0 Aug06 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/rsyslogd -c4

rsyslog configuration is stored in '/etc/rsyslog.conf'. By reviewing the configuration file, we can see that rsyslog on this system is not configured to receive logs:

	# provides UDP syslog reception
	#$ModLoad imudp
	#$UDPServerRun 514

	# provides TCP syslog reception
	#$ModLoad imtcp
	#$InputTCPServerRun 514

However, none of the logging configuration is set to perform logging to a remote system. Unless logs are backed up by a remote system, it is always better to configure remote logging for servers, in rsyslog it is performed by @servername.

## Network review

### General info

It is always good to retrieve, examine, and store basic system configuration information before doing any other checks. I keep the output of the following commands:

	ifconfig -a 

to see what network interfaces are present;

	route -n 

to get the system routes. If the system does not have the route command installed, 'netstat -rn' can be a suitable substitute.

	cat /etc/resolv.conf
	cat /etc/hosts 

to know more about the DNS configuration of the system.

Once you have this information, you will be able to review the firewall and services configuration.

### Firewall Rules

We can retrieve the firewall rules by using iptables:

	# iptables -L -v
	Chain INPUT (policy DROP 2 packets, 1152 bytes)
 	pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
   40  3696 ACCEPT     all  --  lo     any     anywhere             anywhere            
   86  7401 ACCEPT     tcp  --  eth0   any     anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:ssh 
    0     0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  eth0   any     anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:www 
   29  4818 ACCEPT     all  --  any    any     anywhere             anywhere            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED 

	Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 	pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

	Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 16 packets, 1135 bytes)
	 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination  


We can see that these rules allow for in-going traffic:

1.	access from everywhere to the port 80 (HTTP);
2.	access from everywhere to the port 22 (SSH);
3.	access for already known traffic (response to connections initiated by the server itself).
The port 80 (HTTP) will need to be access by anyone on Internet to visit the hosted website. However the port 22 (SSH) should only be accessed by administrators of the server. A white-list of trusted IP addresses should be created to limit access to the SSH server.

We can also see that no rules are applied to the outgoing traffic. It is a best practice to limit outgoing traffic as much as possible by restricting the servers access to the Internet and other internal hosts. Limiting outgoing traffic is likely to slow down an intruder and provide an additional layer of defense-in-depth. For our system review, the server should only allows access on the way out to:

1.	already established connections: like packets going back to the client after he connects to a service;
2.	DNS servers for name resolution;
3.	Debian HTTP servers for software updates.
4.	NTP servers for time synchronisation


We also need to check that the firewall rules will be applied automatically every time the server is started. The Debian way (http://wiki.debian.org/iptables) of doing this is to create a '/etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables' file containing the commands to load the rules:

	# cat /etc/iptables.up.rules                  
	*filter
	:INPUT DROP [0:0]
	:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
	:OUTPUT ACCEPT [27:3016]
    -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT 
    -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT 
    -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT 
    -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    COMMIT

Here we can see that the same rules are applied. It is however very common to get different rules on systems or even on devices (like routers or firewall). That's why it is really important to make sure they correctly match.

### Ipv6

We can check that there is no firewall rule for IPv6 on this host:

	# ip6tables -L -v
	Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 	pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

	Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 	pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

	Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 	pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination 

 At least the same firewall rules applied to IPv4 should be applied for IPv6. If IPv6 is not necessary on this server, it can be disabled, on Debian, by creating a file named '/etc/sysctl.d/disableipv6.conf' that contains the following net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1.


## Filesystem review

### Mounted Partitions

For each entries in the '/etc/fstab', you need to review that:

1.	'noatime' is not used. "noatime" prevents update of inode access time. In case on intrusion, it is always a good idea to have this information;
2.	for file system like '/tmp' or '/home', you can use noexec and nosuid to prevent users from executing binaries and respectively to prevent setuid to be interpreted. It is also recommended that nosuid is included for '/dev', if '/dev' is using devfs.

### Sensitive files

It is important to check permission on sensitive files. As a general rule, you want to check:

1.	that files containing sensitive information (password, private keys) can't be read by any user;
2.	that file containing configuration can't be modified by any user.
For example, the following files shouldn't be readable by any user:

1.	/etc/shadow containing users' passwords (hashed);
2.	/etc/mysql/my.cnf containing debian-sys-maint's password;
3.	SSL private keys used by Apache.
The same obviously applies to any copy of these files, here we can see that a file named '/etc/shadow.backup' is present on the file system and can be read by any user. Even if the permissions are correctly set on the '/etc/shadow', this "backup" file strongly reduces the security of the system.

### Setuid

Setuid files are files ran with owner's privileges, as opposed to normal binaries that are run with current user's privileges. These files are obviously potential security risks, especially if their owner is root. A common example of a setuid file is the utility passwd. In order for users to change their password, they need access to the '/etc/shadow' file, but they cannot be allowed to read the file directly, since this contains the hashed passwords for all users. The setuid bit being set means that this executable will execute as the owner of the file (in this case root), allowing /etc/shadow to be read and modified without allowing the user to directly access the contents of this file.

You can retrieve a list of the setuid files on the system by running the following command:

	# find / -perm -4000 -ls
	[...]
	4948   15 -rwsr-sr-x   1 libuuid  libuuid  15208 Jan 25  2011 /usr/sbin/uuidd
	[...] 
	41584   34 -rwsr-xr-x   1 root     root     34248 Oct 14  2010 /bin/ping
	41585   36 -rwsr-xr-x   1 root     root     36640 Oct 14  2010 /bin/ping6
	41590   34 -rwsr-xr-x   1 root     root     34024 Feb 15  2011 /bin/su
	41595   53 -rwsr-xr-x   1 root     root     53648 Jan 25  2011 /bin/umount

For each file found, you need to check if this file is legitimate and if its permissions are set correctly.

### Normal files

Using find, you can retrieve a list of files that are readable and write-able by any users using the following command:

	# find / -type f -perm -006  2>/dev/null

and a list of files write-able by any users using:

	find / -type f -perm -002  2>/dev/null

You probably want to filter out everything in /proc using | grep -v /proc after the commands above. Once you have done that, you can see that the file in /var/www/ can be read from and written to by any users. This is likely to ease the progress of an attacker gaining illegitimate access to the system.


### Backup

A common mistake performed by system administrators comes from backups. Too often, the backup files can be read by unprivileged users.

On this system, we can see that a directory named '/backup' is present, if we check the permissions of its content we can see that the files can be read by any user. An attacker can use this to extract etc.tgz and read the shadow file. It is important to change permissions on these files and on the /backup directory and to make sure that the script used for backup correctly set the permissions every time it gets called.

## Users review

### Reviewing the passwd file

A common misconfiguration/backdoor of the '/etc/passwd' is to have a user with the uid 0. On traditional systems, only root is supposed to have the uid 0. If another user has the uid 0, he's basically root on the system.

When reviewing /etc/passwd it is always good to check which users have a shell (/bin/bash, /bin/sh ...) and which don't (/bin/false, /usr/sbin/nologin ...) , restricting shell access will ensure the user can't connect and run commands on the system.

### Reviewing the shadow file

In the '/etc/shadow', the most important is to review algorithms used for password encryption and passwords' quality.

You can check what encryption is used by checking the hash format, if the hash:

1.	does not have a $ sign, DES is used;
2.	starts by $1$, MD5 is used;
3.	starts by $2$ or $2a$, Blowfish is used;
4.	starts by $5$, SHA-256 is used;
5.	starts by $6$, SHA-512 is used.
On modern Linux systems, you want to avoid DES and MD5. DES algorithm for password encryption will limit the size of the password to 8 characters and is really easy to crack. MD5 doesn't present the same length weakness but is pretty quick to brute force compared to other algorithms.

You can review what is the default algorithm used to encrypted password by checking the content of '/etc/pam.d/common-password'. Here we can see that sha512 is used:

	$ cat /etc/pam.d/common-password
	[...]
	password  [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so obscure sha512
	[...]

To improve the system security, you can add some requirements on the password by installing libpam-cracklib:

	# apt-get install  libpam-cracklib

To enforce the complexity, you can play with the parameter minlen to enforce the complexity and lcredit, ucredit, dcredit and ocredit to force the number of lowercase, uppercase, digit and special characters in the password.

After installing libcrack, the following line has been added to the '/etc/pam.d/common-password' to enforce the complexity of passwords:

	$ cat /etc/pam.d/common-password
	[...]
	password        requisite                       pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=8 difok=4
	[...]

We can see here another important parameter: difok, that tells pam how many characters in the new password must be different from the previous password.

To force the number of special characters and digits in the password, you can change the line above to:

	$ cat /etc/pam.d/common-password
	[...]
	password        requisite                       pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=8 difok=4 ocredit=-2 dcredit=-1
	[...]

It will enforce one digit and two special characters in the password. You can read more about pam_cracklib configuration by running: man pam_cracklib on the system.

### Reviewing the sudo configuration

The sudo configuration is stored in '/etc/sudoers':

	# egrep -v '^#|^$'  /etc/sudoers
	Defaults  env_reset
	root  ALL=(ALL) ALL
	%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL
	user  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

We can see there that the user named user can be any users (including root) without any passwords and without restriction.

A common mistake with sudo is to provide a user with a limited set of commands that will still allow him to get a root shell on the system. For example, a user with access to '/bin/chown' (change owner) and '/bin/chmod' (change mode) will be able to copy a shell in his home and change the shell owner to root and add the setuid bit on the file. This way, this user will be able to have a root shell on the system.

## Services Review

### Identifying running services

Using ps, you can quickly identified running services:

	# ps -edf 
	UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
	root         1     0  0 02:21 ?        00:00:00 init [2]         
	root         2     0  0 02:21 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
	root         3     2  0 02:21 ?        00:00:00 [migration/0]
	root         4     2  0 02:21 ?        00:00:00 [ksoftirqd/0]

Another good way to list potentially interesting services is to use lsof to get the list of network connection and especially services listening on the network.

We can first work on the service listening on UDP:

	# lsof -i UDP -n -P
	COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
	ntpd     1397  ntp   16u  IPv4   3861      0t0  UDP *:123 
	ntpd     1397  ntp   17u  IPv6   3869      0t0  UDP *:123 
	ntpd     1397  ntp   18u  IPv4   3875      0t0  UDP 127.0.0.1:123 
	ntpd     1397  ntp   19u  IPv6   3876      0t0  UDP [::1]:123 
	ntpd     1397  ntp   20u  IPv4   5418      0t0  UDP 10.0.2.15:123 
	ntpd     1397  ntp   21u  IPv6   5419      0t0  UDP [fe80::5054:ff:fe12:3456]:123 
	dhclient 1727 root    6u  IPv4   3937      0t0  UDP *:68 

Here we can see:

1.	ntpd is running on port UDP/123 on IPv6 and IPv4;
2.	dhclient for dynamic network configuration is running on port UDP/68.


Then get information about the TCP services:

	# lsof -i TCP -n -P
	COMMAND  PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
	mysqld  1555    mysql   10u  IPv4   4073      0t0  TCP *:3306 (LISTEN)
	sshd    1758     root    3u  IPv4   4966      0t0  TCP *:22 (LISTEN)
	sshd    1758     root    4u  IPv6   4968      0t0  TCP *:22 (LISTEN)
	sshd    1845     root    3r  IPv4   5615      0t0  TCP 10.0.2.15:22->10.0.2.2:52439 (ESTABLISHED)
	sshd    1848     user    3u  IPv4   5615      0t0  TCP 10.0.2.15:22->10.0.2.2:52439 (ESTABLISHED)
	apache2 1966     root    3u  IPv4   6502      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)
	apache2 1969 www-data    3u  IPv4   6502      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)
	apache2 1970 www-data    3u  IPv4   6502      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)
	apache2 1971 www-data    3u  IPv4   6502      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)
	apache2 1972 www-data    3u  IPv4   6502      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)

Here we can see:

1.	Apache2 is running and listening on the port TCP/80 on IPv4;
2.	mysqld is listening on port TCP/3006 on IPv4;
3.	sshd is running on port TCP/22 on IPv6 and IPv4;
4.	someone (user) is connected to the SSH server.


### OpenSSH

OpenSSH is running on this system; its configuration file can be found in /etc/ssh/ and is named sshd_config. The main thing to check for is the PermitRootLogin option that will prevent root to connect directly to the system. The default value of this option is yes, so you should me sure that it is set to no and that the line is not commented in the configuration file.

Additionally, it is wise to check that SSH version 1 is disabled, if it is not required.

Since the system is available to the Internet, it is a good idea to change the default port (don't forget to put this new value in the firewall configuration) to make it less likely that automated brute-force/SSH scanners will locate this service. This can be done by changing the Port value in the configuration file ('/etc/ssh/sshd_config').

Since this server is not a bounce box, AllowTcpForwarding should be set to no to prevent users from using this system to access other system or to bypass network-layer security restrictions. The default value is yes, so you need to make sure that no is used and that the line is not commented.

To update its configuration, SSH will need to be restarted.

### Apache Configuration

Since the server is used as a web server, it is important to review the configuration of the web server: Apache.

First, it is always good to check which user the web server is running as, you can find out by running ps or by reviewing Apache's configuration and search for the values User and Group. Here they are available in '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf':

	# These need to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
	User ${APACHE_RUN_USER}
	Group ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP}

We can see that the values used are extracted from /etc/apache2/envvars:

	export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
	export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data

All good, we have here a traditional Debian setup and the service is not running as root. Running a server as root will increase the consequence of a bug's exploitation in the service itself or in any web applications hosted.

To ensure that no local users can modify the hosted website and to harden exploitation of possible vulnerability, it's always a good idea to limit access to the web root. Here, we can see that the DocumentRoot is '/var/www/wordpress', using ls, we can check that the permission are not correctly restricted:

	# ls -lR /var/www/wordpress
	/var/www/wordpress/:
	total 125
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data   395 Jul 11 07:02 index.php
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data 19929 Jul 11 07:02 license.txt
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data  9177 Jul 11 07:02 readme.html
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data  4264 Jul 11 07:02 wp-activate.php
	drwxrwxrwx 9 www-data www-data  1913 Aug  6 03:26 wp-admin
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data  1354 Jul 11 07:02 wp-app.php
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data   271 Jul 11 07:02 wp-blog-header.php
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data  3522 Jul 11 07:02 wp-comments-post.php
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data  3456 Jul 11 21:51 wp-config.php
	[ ... ]

The files should not be available to any users. In order to restrict the risk of overwrite by the web server, the complete application ownership can be given to a third user. This way, the web server will not be able to modify the web application. This is however likely to break some applications.

As best practices, it is always good to avoid extra-information in the server headers. To prevent Apache from leaking to much information, the following parameters should be reviewed:

ServerTokens: the recommended value is Prod;
ServerSignature should be turned Off.
On Debian, these two parameters are configured in the '/etc/apache2/conf.d/security'.

To limit the server exposure to information leak, it is always good to disable directory listing. Directory listing is configured by the parameter Indexes. By reviewing the configuration of the website available in '/etc/apache2/sites-enable/000-default', we can see that directory listing is enabled:

	<Directory /var/www/wordpress/>
   		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
   		AllowOverride None
  		Order allow,deny
   		allow from all
	</Directory>

### PHP configuration

Here, we are going to focus on the PHP configuration used by Apache2. We can see in Apache configuration that the following file is loaded:

	# cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.load
	LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so

If we run strings on that binary and search for apache2, we can see some interesting information:

	# strings /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so  | grep apache2
	/etc/php5/apache2
	/etc/php5/apache2/conf.d
	/tmp/buildd/php5-5.3.3/sapi/apache2handler/mod_php5.c
	apache2hook_post_config
	apache2handler
	/tmp/buildd/php5-5.3.3/sapi/apache2handler/sapi_apache2.c

We can see two paths that are actually where PHP will look for it is configuration. By reading the Debian documentation, we can confirm that the PHP configuration used by Apache2 is stored in the '/etc/php5/apache2 directory'.

First, as we saw for Apache, it is always a good idea to hide the value of PHP in use. The parameter expose_php tells PHP to add an extra HTTP header X-Powered-By in all responses. It is better to hide this information by turning expose_php off.

Furthermore, the following options need to be reviewed:

1.	'display_errors' should be turned Off in production;
2.	'error_reporting' should be set to E_ALL;
3.	'log_errors' should be turned On;
4.	'safe_mode' can be bypassed but it will definitely slow down an attacker; it should be turned On;
5.	'disable_functions' can be used to block access to sensitive functions like: eval, exec, passthru, shell_exec, system, proc_open, popen...
6.	'allow_url_include' should be turned Off.


### Crontab

Crontab is used on Linux/UNIX to run tasks at a given time. You can find the list of crontabs in /var/spool/cron/crontabs or using the command 'crontab -u <user> -l' to list the tasks for a given user.

One of the important thing to look for is the permission on scripts called by a task. For example, here the script '/root/backup.sh' is automatically ran in root's task ('/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root'):

	0 2 * * * /root/backup.sh


We can check the permissions on this file and see that anyone can modify this file:

	# ls -l /root/backup.sh 
    -rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 84 Aug  6 03:38 /root/backup.sh

The permissions on this script should be modified to prevent any user from modifying the script to gain root access the next time the task is ran.

It's also important to avoid sensitive tasks between 2am and 3am or they will be ran 0 or 2 times during daylight savings (expect if the system timezone does not have daylight savings).

## Conclusion

This guide showed you how to review a Linux system to find potential security issues and how to correct them. We hope the course provides you with more details on how a Linux system can be insecurely configured and how you can quickly improve its security. This example is quiet simple but is representative of most web servers you will find on the Internet.

Thank you.
