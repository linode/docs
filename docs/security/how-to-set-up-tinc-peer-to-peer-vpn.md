![How to Set up tinc, a Peer-to-Peer VPN](/docs/assets/tinc.jpg "How to Set up tinc, a Peer-to-Peer VPN")

Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are an essential part of any serious network security deployment plan. There are many open-source VPN options but one of them shines above the others: tinc. All VPNs behave as a secure tunnel between two points, but tinc stands out for its "Peer-to-Peer" design. The design allows tinc users a great deal of flexibility, especially when planning a mesh-type network.

From a clear two-server connection to complex mesh private network, this guide will show you how to configure tinc VPN in three different use-case scenarios.

## Before You Begin

To complete all of the different configurations in this guide, you will need multiple Linodes. For each Linode, complete the following steps:

1.  Complete the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide.

2.  Follow the [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server/) guide to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services.

    This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Please ensure you have access to privileged user rights.

3.  Update your packages:

        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

{: .note}
>In order to focus on tinc configuration, three assumptions are made:
>
>1. There are no active firewalls on any server.
>2. Each server is connected directly to the Internet (no router or proxy is involved).
>3. Each server is running the same version of tinc.

## Basic Setup: Two Node tinc VPN


The typical use case for a two-node tinc is web-based invoicing software, where the database should be on a separate server (for security and disaster recovery), and needs to communicate sensitive data to the application server through the internet.
This is a straightforward setup involving only two instances, an Application Server *(appserver)* and a Database Server *(dbserver)*. Each instance will run on a separate Linode:

![Two Node VPN](/docs/assets/tinc-two-node.png)

### Gather Network Information

Before getting started, it's a good idea to create a "cheat-sheet" with network information, including the public IPv4 addresses for both servers, desired VPN address for each instance, VPN network name designations, and a tinc-daemon name for each node. The VPN address can be an arbitrary private network IPv4 address, the only rule to follow (if you want to avoid extra routing work) is that they must have the **same network prefix**, just like a typical LAN. VPN and daemon names must be unique and can't contain any spaces or special symbols. For the current use-case the following information will be used for tinc configuration:

![Two node VPN cheat-sheet](/docs/assets/tinc-2-node-cheat-sheet.jpg)

{:.note}
> Throughout this guide, replace the IP address for each server with the public IP address of the corresponding Linode.

### Install tinc VPN on Ubuntu 16.04

Ubuntu 16.04 will be used for all of the Linodes in this guide. Other distros can be used, but the steps to install the latest version of tinc will vary. At the time of this writing the latest stable version of tinc is 1.0.31. Ubuntu's repositories use an older version, so you will have to build from source:

1. Install the necessary dependencies for building tinc:

       sudo apt install build-essential automake libssl-dev liblzo2-dev libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev

2. Get the latest version of tinc from the developer's site:

       wget http://tinc-vpn.org/packages/tinc-1.0.31.tar.gz

3. Extract the archive in a temporary folder:

       tar -xf tinc-1.0.31.tar.gz

4. Compile tinc on your system:

       cd tinc-1.0.31
       ./configure --prefix=
       make
       sudo make install

### Create VPN Working Directory

You can implement as many tinc networks as you need as long as you create a unique working directory for each one (gaming VPN, backups VPN, etc). The name of the folder must match the designated name for your VPN in this case: *linodeVPN*. You also need to use the same structure across the servers, which means you need to create the working directory on both:

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts

### Create Configuration Files

You will be required to set up a **main** configuration file titled `tinc.conf` on each server. The default location for this file is the root of the working directory.

1.  Let's start with the Application Server file:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
    :   ~~~ conf
    Name = appserver
    Device = /dev/net/tun
    AddressFamily = ipv4
    ~~~

    * `Name` - This is daemon-specific name within the VPN. It should be unique.
    * `Device` - Determines the virtual network to use, tinc will automatically detect what kind of device you are using.
    * `AddressFamily` - Tell tinc which type of address to use.

2.  Now you need to generate the database server configuration file:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
    :   ~~~ conf
    Name = dbserver
    Device = /dev/net/tun
    AddressFamily = ipv4
    ConnectTo = appserver
    ~~~

    `ConnectTo` - This value points to the tinc daemon you want to connect. When it's not present (like in the previous file), tinc enters listening mode and waits for connections.

    {: .note}
    >
    >You can customize tinc behavior with many other parameters in the configuration file, for more information visit the [tinc documentation](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/documentation/tinc.conf.5).

3.  Create the **hosts** configuration file. Because tinc is built using a peer-to-peer model each node needs to communicate with the others. The basic host file for the Application Server is:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/appserver
    : ~~~ conf
      Address = 11.11.11.11
      Subnet = 192.168.100.209
    ~~~

4.  Similarly, create a host file for Database Server:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/dbserver
    : ~~~ conf
      Address = 22.22.22.22
      Subnet = 192.168.100.130
      ~~~

5.  Add the public key of each node. tinc can create the key pair using the following command:

        sudo tincd -n linodeVPN -K 4096

    For this example we're using 4096-bit encryption, you can choose a higher level if necessary. Save both keys `rsa_key.pub` and `rsa_key.priv` in the root of your working directory `/etc/tinc/linodeVPN`.

6.  Next, append the `rsa_key.pub` at the end of each host file. From the Application server:

        sudo bash -c "cat /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/rsa_key.pub >> /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/appserver"

    From the database server run a similar command:

        sudo bash -c "cat /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/rsa_key.pub >> /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/dbserver"

### Create VPN Control Scripts

Control scripts are responsible for setting up virtual interfaces on each server. They're needed on both servers.

1.  From the Application server, create the following file to enable the tinc interface:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-up
    :   ~~~ conf
        #!/bin/sh
        ip link set $INTERFACE up
        ip addr add 192.168.100.209 dev $INTERFACE
        ip route add 192.168.100.0/24 dev $INTERFACE
        ~~~

    Create a script to disable the interface:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-down
    :   ~~~ conf
        #!/bin/sh
        ip route del 192.168.100.0/24 dev $INTERFACE
        ip addr del 192.168.100.209 dev $INTERFACE
        ip link set $INTERFACE down
        ~~~

2.  Create a similar set of scripts from the Database server:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-up
    :   ~~~ conf
        #!/bin/sh
        ip link set $INTERFACE up
        ip addr add 192.168.100.130 dev $INTERFACE
        ip route add 192.168.100.0/24 dev $INTERFACE
        ~~~

        And another script to shutdown it:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-down
    :   ~~~ conf
        #!/bin/sh
        ip route del 192.168.100.0/24 dev $INTERFACE
        ip addr del 192.168.100.209 dev $INTERFACE
        ip link set $INTERFACE down
        ~~~

3.  After creating the control scripts you will need to change the permissions, on both servers, accordingly:

        sudo chmod -v +x /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-{up,down}

### Create tinc Unit File

In order to run tinc as a service on startup, you'll need to set up the proper Unit file for each server. Edit the following file from both the application and database servers.

{:.file}
/etc/systemd/system/tinc.service
:   ~~~ conf
    [Unit]
    Description=Tinc net linodeVPN
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    WorkingDirectory=/etc/tinc/linodeVPN
    ExecStart=/sbin/tincd -n linodeVPN -D -d3
    ExecReload=/sbin/tincd -n linodeVPN -kHUP
    TimeoutStopSec=5
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=60

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ~~~

{: .note}
>
>For tinc unit a debug level of "3" was chosen in the `tincd` command. This will log all requests from other daemons and include an authentication chain between them. For more information about debug levels please read the [tincd documentation](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/documentation/tincd.8).

### Host Files Interchange

At this point, you have configuration files created on each server. Because of tinc's P2P nature, the last thing you need to do is interchange host files between nodes. There are many ways to accomplish this, for the purposes of this guide we'll use `scp`.

From `appserver`:

    scp /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/appserver <user>@<dbserver>:/tmp/
    ssh -t <user>@<dbserver> sudo mv -v /tmp/appserver /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/

From `dbserver`:

    scp /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/dbserver <user>@<appserver>:/tmp/
    ssh -t <user>@<appserver> sudo mv -v /tmp/dbserver /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/

### Test tinc

1.  It's time to test your newly configured VPN. From the application server start the `tincd` daemon:

        sudo tincd -n linodeVPN -D -d3

2.  And now from database server do the same:

        sudo tincd -n linodeVPN -D -d3

    If everything has been configured successfully you should see an output similar to this:

    ![VPN output](/docs/assets/appserver-dbserver-output.jpg "VPN output")

3.  You can open another terminal (i.e., from `appserver`) and check the active interfaces:

        sudo ip a

    You should have at least three interfaces, one of them your `linodeVPN`.

Another quick test you can do is to `ping` the Database Server from the Application Server using its VPN address:

    ping 192.168.100.130

If you encounter errors during your testing you can add this flag to your daemon command:

    sudo tincd -n --logfile[=FILE] linodeVPN -D -d5

### Complete Your tinc Configuration

Once you have your tinc VPN ready you can enable the service on startup:

    sudo systemctl enable tinc.service

Now you can start, stop, restart, and check the service using common `systemd` syntax.

    sudo systemctl status tinc.service

## How to Deploy a Three-Node tinc mesh

This topology can be considered a variant of the single-node where a high traffic application requires separate instances to scale, resource optimization and faster response (asynchronous processing).

![Three-Node VPN](/docs/assets/tinc-three-node.png "Three-Node VPN")

In the interest of showcasing tinc's easy expandability, we'll assume that **LINODE1** and **LINODE2** are the same application server and database server from the previous section.

The "cheat-sheet" for this topology is:

![Three-Node cheat-sheet](/docs/assets/tinc-3-node-cheat-sheet.jpg "Three-Node cheat-sheet")

1.  Configure the new webserver (Linode 3). Follow the previously explained steps to install the tinc VPN and create the working directory.

2.  The main configuration file for this instance would be:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
    :   ~~~ conf
        Name = webserver
        Device = /dev/net/tun
        AddressFamily = ipv4
        ConnectTo = appserver
        ConnectTo = dbserver
        ~~~

3.  Edit the host file:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/webserver
    :   ~~~ conf
        Address = 33.33.33.33
        Subnet = 192.168.100.140
        ~~~

4. This time increase the security level on the encryption keys:

       sudo tincd -n linodeVPN -K 8192

5.  Once again, you need to append the public key to the host file:

        sudo bash -c "cat /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/rsa_key.pub >> /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/webserver"

6.  Add control scripts:

    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-up
    :   ~~~ conf
        #!/bin/sh
        ip link set $INTERFACE up
        ip addr add 192.168.100.140 dev $INTERFACE
        ip route add 192.168.100.0/24 dev $INTERFACE
        ~~~


    {: .file}
    /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-down
    :   ~~~ conf
        #!/bin/sh
        ip route del 192.168.100.0/24 dev $INTERFACE
        ip addr del 192.168.100.140 dev $INTERFACE
        ip link set $INTERFACE down
        ~~~

7.  Change permissions:

        sudo chmod -v +x /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-{up,down}

8.  The unit file on this server will be identical to the previous servers:

    {: .file}
    /etc/systemd/system/tinc.service
    :   ~~~ conf
        [Unit]
        Description=Tinc net linodeVPN
        After=network.target

        [Service]
        Type=simple
        WorkingDirectory=/etc/tinc/linodeVPN
        ExecStart=/sbin/tincd -n linodeVPN -D -d3
        ExecReload=/sbin/tincd -n linodeVPN -kHUP
        TimeoutStopSec=5
        Restart=always
        RestartSec=60

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
        ~~~

9.  The last step is to interchange host files between all nodes. You will need to copy application and database servers host files to webserver and webserver's host file to both of them.

    From `webserver`:

        scp /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/webserver <user>@<appserver>:/tmp/
        ssh -t <user>@<appserver> sudo mv -v /tmp/webserver /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/

        scp /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/webserver <user>@<dbserver>:/tmp/
        ssh -t <user>@<dbserver> sudo mv -v /tmp/webserver /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/

    From `appserver`:

        scp /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/appserver <user>@<webserver>:/tmp/
        ssh -t <user>@<webserver> sudo mv -v /tmp/appserver /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/

    From `dbserver`:

        scp /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/dbserver <user>@<webserver>:/tmp/
        ssh -t <user>@<webserver> sudo mv -v /tmp/dbserver /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/


10.  Finally, modify the `tinc.conf` file on `appserver` and `dbserver`. The new configuration files need to tell tinc to look for other nodes:

        {: .file}
        /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
        :   ~~~ conf
            Name = appserver
            Device = /dev/net/tun
            AddressFamily = ipv4
            ConnectTo = dbserver
            ConnectTo = webserver
            ~~~


        {: .file}
        /etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
        :   ~~~ conf
            Name = dbserver
            Device = /dev/net/tun
            AddressFamily = ipv4
            ConnectTo = appserver
            ConnectTo = webserver
            ~~~

11.  Now you can start the tinc service on the webserver:

         sudo systemctl enable tinc.service
         sudo systemctl start tinc.service

## Use tinc for Centralized Cloud Interconnection

This setup illustrates a use-case where regional branches need to interact with an application running at a headquarters, like a centralized inventory management software.
In the last use-case, you will configure a VPN with four Linode servers. Each server should be in a different geographic location.

![Centralized Cloud VPN](/docs/assets/tinc-four-node.png "Centralized Cloud VPN")

The cheat-sheet in this case is:

![Centralized VPN cheat-sheet](/docs/assets/tinc-4-node-cheat-sheet.jpg "Centralized VPN cheat-sheet")

After the previous two sections, you should be familiar with the configuration procedure:

1. Install tinc VPN on each node.
2. Create VPN working directory on each node.
3. Create `tinc.conf` and host files on every node.
4. Create VPN control scripts for all tinc instances.
5. Create unit files.
6. Interchange host files across all nodes.
7. Enable tinc unit(s)

The configuration file `tinc.conf` on Linodes 1, 2, and 3 should point only to Linode HQ (`ConnectTo`). The configuration file on Linode HQ should define connections with all nodes using the same directive. The corresponding configuration files are:

**Linode1:**

{: .file}
/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
:   ~~~ conf
    Name = linode1
    Device = /dev/net/tun
    AddressFamily = ipv4
    ConnectTo = linodeHQ
    ~~~

**Linode2:**

{: .file}
/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
:   ~~~ conf
    Name = linode2
    Device = /dev/net/tun
    AddressFamily = ipv4
    ConnectTo = linodeHQ
    ~~~

**Linode3:**

{: .file}
/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
:   ~~~ conf
    Name = linode3
    Device = /dev/net/tun
    AddressFamily = ipv4
    ConnectTo = linodeHQ
    ~~~

**And finally on the central server:**

{: .file}
/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc.conf
:   ~~~ conf
    Name = linodeHQ
    Device = /dev/net/tun
    AddressFamily = ipv4
    ConnectTo = linode1
    ConnectTo = linode2
    ConnectTo = linode3
    ~~~
