A security vulnerability in OpenSSL dubbed **Heartbleed** has been found. This vulnerability was only recently discovered openly, but has been "in the wild" for over a year. It's important to update your local version of OpenSSL to correct this issue. This brief guide will walk you through ensuring that the patch is installed on your Linode, and suggest additional steps you can take to ensure your server's security. As always, we suggest having backups of your system prior to making any changes.

This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you're not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Installing the Patched Version

Here are the steps for ensuring you have the patched versions of OpenSSL on our most popular distros. If you've compiled from source, you'll want to compile and reinstall using version 1.0.1g. Alternately you can recompile previous versions with the `OPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS` flag enabled to close the vulnerability.

### Ubuntu and Debian

1.  Check to see what your current OpenSSL version is:

        $ openssl version -a
        OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
        built on: Sat Feb  1 22:14:33 UTC 2014
        platform: debian-amd64
        options:  bn(64,64) rc4(16x,int) des(idx,cisc,16,int) blowfish(idx)
        compiler: gcc -fPIC -DOPENSSL_PIC -DZLIB -DOPENSSL_THREADS -D_REENTRANT -DDSO_DLFCN -DHAVE_DLFCN_H -m64 -DL_ENDIAN -DTERMIO -g -O2 -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wformat -Werror=format-security -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wl,-z,relro -Wa,--noexecstack -Wall -DMD32_REG_T=int -DOPENSSL_IA32_SSE2 -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT5 -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_GF2m -DSHA1_ASM -DSHA256_ASM -DSHA512_ASM -DMD5_ASM -DAES_ASM -DVPAES_ASM -DBSAES_ASM -DWHIRLPOOL_ASM -DGHASH_ASM
        OPENSSLDIR: "/usr/lib/ssl"

	Pay attention to the `built on:` line. Versions built before April 7th are vulnerable.

2.  For Debian and Ubuntu systems, run these commands to update and upgrade your packages:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get upgrade

3.  During the upgrade, you may be given a prompt like the one below. This window warns you about the security issue, and lists services that utilize OpenSSL and need to be restarted to apply the patch. You can add any additional services, by matching the init.d script name in this field.

    [![An option window..](/docs/assets/1715-openssl-patch-1_small.png)](/docs/assets/1714-openssl-patch-1.png)

	If you do not receive this prompt, be sure to manually restart any services that use OpenSSL.

4.  After updating, run `openssl version -a` again to confirm the newer build:

        openssl version -a
        OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012
        built on: Mon Apr  7 20:33:29 UTC 2014

        ...

### CentOS

1.  Check to see what your current OpenSSL version is:

        openssl version -a
        OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
        built on: Wed Jan  8 18:40:59 UTC 2014
        platform: linux-x86_64
        options:  bn(64,64) md2(int) rc4(16x,int) des(idx,cisc,16,int) idea(int) blowfish(idx)
        compiler: gcc -fPIC -DOPENSSL_PIC -DZLIB -DOPENSSL_THREADS -D_REENTRANT -DDSO_DLFCN -DHAVE_DLFCN_H -DKRB5_MIT -m64 -DL_ENDIAN -DTERMIO -Wall -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fexceptions -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -m64 -mtune=generic -Wa,--noexecstack -DPURIFY -DOPENSSL_IA32_SSE2 -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT5 -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_GF2m -DSHA1_ASM -DSHA256_ASM -DSHA512_ASM -DMD5_ASM -DAES_ASM -DVPAES_ASM -DBSAES_ASM -DWHIRLPOOL_ASM -DGHASH_ASM
        OPENSSLDIR: "/etc/pki/tls"
        engines:  dynamic

	Pay attention to the `built on:` line. Versions built before April 7th are vulnerable.

2.  To update OpenSSL from the repositories, run:

        yum -y install openssl

	After updating, run `openssl version -a` again to confirm the newer build:

		openssl version -a
		OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
		built on: Tue Apr  8 02:39:29 UTC 2014

		...

3.  Be sure to manually restart any services that use OpenSSL.

### Fedora

1.  Check to see what your current OpenSSL version is:

        openssl version -a
        OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
        built on: Fri Dec 20 13:57:26 UTC 2013
        platform: linux-x86_64
        options:  bn(64,64) md2(int) rc4(16x,int) des(idx,cisc,16,int) idea(int) blowfish(idx)
        compiler: gcc -fPIC -DOPENSSL_PIC -DZLIB -DOPENSSL_THREADS -D_REENTRANT -DDSO_DLFCN -DHAVE_DLFCN_H -DKRB5_MIT -m64 -DL_ENDIAN -DTERMIO -Wall -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fexceptions -fstack-protector-strong --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -grecord-gcc-switches  -m64 -mtune=generic -Wa,--noexecstack -DPURIFY -DOPENSSL_IA32_SSE2 -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT5 -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_GF2m -DSHA1_ASM -DSHA256_ASM -DSHA512_ASM -DMD5_ASM -DAES_ASM -DVPAES_ASM -DBSAES_ASM -DWHIRLPOOL_ASM -DGHASH_ASM
        OPENSSLDIR: "/etc/pki/tls"
        engines:  dynamic

	Pay attention to the `built on:` line. Versions built before April 7th are vulnerable.

2.  On Fedora systems, the patched version is currently being propagated through mirrors. You can update from the repositories with the following command:

        sudo yum -y install openssl

3.  After updating, run `openssl version -a` again to confirm the newer build:

        openssl version -a
        OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
        built on: Tue Apr  8 00:32:22 UTC 2014

        ...

4.  Be sure to manually restart any services that use OpenSSL.

## Reissue Certificates

The Heartbleed security bug would allow an attacker to read a portion of the memory on an unprotected system, including private keys used in SSL key pairs. It's suggested that you reissue all key pairs, and revoke ones made previously. This can include keys used to create SSL certificates for web and mail servers. This means new SSL certificates should be generated or purchased.

You can follow the instructions [here](/docs/security/ssl/obtaining-a-commercial-ssl-certificate/#create-a-certificate-signing-request) to create a new certificate signing request (CSR) and key.

## Additional Security Steps

While this security flaw has only recently been discovered *openly*, it has existed on many servers for well over a year. This means that any third party services you use that employ SSL encryption have been vulnerable. It's suggested that you ensure that said services patch their systems, then reset your passwords.
