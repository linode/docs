MySQL Master-Master replication adds speed and redundancy for active websites. With replication, two separate MySQL servers act as a cluster. Database clustering is particularly useful for high availability website configurations. Use two separate Linodes to configure database replication, each with private IPv4 addresses.

##Install MySQL

Use the following commands to install MySQL on each of the Linodes:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client

##Edit MySQL's Configuration

1.  Edit the `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` file on each of the Linodes. Add or modify the following values:

    **Server 1:**

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /etc/mysql/my.cnf
    : ~~~ conf
    server_id           = 1
    log_bin             = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
    log_bin_index       = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log.index
    relay_log           = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin
    relay_log_index     = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.index
    expire_logs_days    = 10
    max_binlog_size     = 100M
    log_slave_updates   = 1
    auto-increment-increment = 2
    auto-increment-offset = 1
    ~~~

    **Server 2:**

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /etc/mysql/my.cnf
    : ~~~ conf
    server_id           = 2
    log_bin             = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
    log_bin_index       = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log.index
    relay_log           = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin
    relay_log_index     = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.index
    expire_logs_days    = 10
    max_binlog_size     = 100M
    log_slave_updates   = 1
    auto-increment-increment = 2
    auto-increment-offset = 2
    ~~~

2.  For each of the Linodes, edit the `bind-address` configuration in order to use the private IP addresses:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /etc/mysql/my.cnf
    : ~~~
    bind-address    = x.x.x.x
    ~~~

3.  Once completed, restart the MySQL application:

        sudo service mysql restart

##Create Replication Users

1.  Log in to MySQL on each of the Linodes:

        mysql -u root -p

2.  Configure the replication users on each Linode.  Replace `x.x.x.x` with the private IP address of the opposing Linode, and `password` with a strong password:

        GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replication'@'x.x.x.x' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

3.  Run the following command to test the configuration. Use the private IP address of the opposing Linode:

        mysql -u replication -p -h x.x.x.x -P 3306

    This command should connect you to the remote server's MySQL instance.

##Configure Database Replication


1.  While logged into MySQL on Server 1, query the master status:

        SHOW MASTER STATUS;

    Note the file and position values that are displayed:

        mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
        +------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
        | File             | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB |
        +------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
        | mysql-bin.000001 |      277 |              |                  |
        +------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
        1 row in set (0.00 sec)

2.  On Server 2 at the MySQL prompt, set up the slave functionality for that database.  Replace`x.x.x.x` with the private IP from the first server. Also replace the value for `master_log_file` with the file value from the previous step, and the value for `master_log_pos` with the position value.

        STOP SLAVE;
        CHANGE MASTER TO master_host='x.x.x.x', master_port=3306, master_user='replication', master_password='password', master_log_file='mysql-bin.000001', master_log_pos=106;
        START SLAVE;

3.  On Server 2, query the master status. Again note the file and position values.

        SHOW MASTER STATUS;

4.  Set the slave database status on Server 1, replacing the same values swapped in step 2 with those from the Server 2.

        STOP SLAVE;
        CHANGE MASTER TO master_host='x.x.x.x', master_port=3306, master_user='replication', master_password='password', master_log_file='mysql-bin.000001', master_log_pos=277;
        START SLAVE;

5.  Test by creating a database and inserting a row:

    Server 1:

        create database test;
        create table test.flowers (`id` varchar(10));

    Server 2:

        show tables in test;

When queried, you should see the tables from Server 1 replicated on Server 2.  Congratulations, you now have a MySQL Master-Master cluster!
