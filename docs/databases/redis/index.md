Redis is an open source data store solution designed for deployments in high performance environments and for applications where performance and flexibility are more critical than data persistence and absolute data integrity. Designed as a key-value store or a "data structures storage system", Redis may be considered a participant in the "NoSQL" movement like [MongoDB](/docs/databases/mongodb/) and [CouchDB](/docs/databases/couchdb/). These documents provide both instructions for deploying the Redis server and overviews of best practices for maintaining Redis instances.
