description: "Redis is an open-source data-store solution designed for deployments in high performance environments and for applications where performance and flexibility are more critical than data persistence and absolute data integrity. <br/><br/> Designed as a key-value store or a 'data structures storage system,' Redis may be considered a participant in the 'NoSQL' movement, like [MongoDB](/docs/databases/mongodb/) and [CouchDB](/docs/databases/couchdb/). The guides in this section provide both instructions for deploying the Redis server and overviews of best practices for maintaining Redis instances."
