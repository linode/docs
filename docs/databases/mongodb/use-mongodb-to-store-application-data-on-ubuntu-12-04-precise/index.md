MongoDB is a database engine that provides access to non-relational key-value databases. It is part of the growing NoSQL movement, which seeks to provide an alternative to traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). In addition to its schema-free design and scalable architecture, MongoDB provides a JSON-based output format and specialized language specific bindings that make it particularly attractive for use in custom application development. Although MongoDB is a relatively new project, the software has been used in a number of large scale [production deployments](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Deployments).

Before installing MongoDB, it is assume that you have followed our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/). If you are new to Linux server administration, you may be interested in our [introduction to Linux concepts guide](/docs/tools-reference/introduction-to-linux-concepts/), [beginner's guide](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/linode-beginners-guide/) and [administration basics guide](/docs/tools-reference/linux-system-administration-basics/).

# Installing MongoDB

Make sure your package repositories and installed programs are up to date by issuing the following commands:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded

Enter the following command to install MongoDB server:

    apt-get install mongodb-server

# Configure MongoDB Server

By default, the configuration file for mongodb-server is located at `/etc/mongodb.conf`. Most of the settings are fairly self-explanatory and well-commented, but we've outlined some of the more important options below.

The `dbpath` option indicates where the database files will be stored (`/var/lib/mongodb` by default). The `logpath` directive indicates where MongoDB's logs will be located (`/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log` by default). `logappend` indicates whether or not new entries will be appended to the end of the log rather than overwriting existing log entries after each time MongoDB restarts.

The `bind_ip` option specifies which IP address(es) MongoDB should listen on. It is generally recommended to leave this at the default setting of 127.0.0.1 (localhost) unless you have a specific reason to host this DB to the public internet. Specifying `0.0.0.0` here will cause MongoDB to listen on *all* network interfaces. The `port` option in this file specifies the default port, but can be modified depending on your needs.

To provide additional security, it is recommended that you set the `auth` option to `true` in order to take advantage of MongoDB's internal authentication capabilities. If you need to test the database without authentication, you can replace the `auth` option to `noauth`.

Please note that after making any changes to the MongoDB configuration file, you'll always need to restart the service for the changes to take effect (see below).

# Starting and Stopping the MongoDB Server

To start, restart, or stop MongoDB, issue the appropriate command from the following:

    service mongodb start
    service mongodb restart
    service mongodb stop

Congratulations, you now have a fully functional installation of the MongoDB system.

# Additional MongoDB Functionality

Now that MongoDB is running properly, you can begin to explore some of its features. Most interaction with MongoDB is done via the rich set of [language-specific drivers](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Drivers). There are a number of tools that are installed by default that you might find useful for interacting with MongoDB databases. The `mongo` utility provides an interactive JavaScript shell for MongoDB including commands such as `mongodump` and `mongorestore` for creating and restoring backups and snapshots, as well as `mongoexport` and `mongoimportjson` for exporting individual collections in JSON format.

You can now fully enjoy application development with MongoDB!
