description: "MariaDB is a community-developed, open-source, drop-in replacement for the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), MySQL. Its high compatibility with MySQL affords MariaDB library binary equivalency and exact-matching API and commands. It replaces MySQL's InnoDB storage engine with both XtraDB and transactional/non-transactional Aria storage engines.<br/><br/>According to [MariaDB.com](https://mariadb.com/), the RDBMS renders 'enterprise-grade performance, industry-leading security, world-class support and modern, unique architecture, extensible at every layer so users and the community can extend functionality to meet unique needs.'"
