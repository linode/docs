1.  Install the official Elastic APT package signing key:

        wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

2.  Install the `apt-transport-https` package, which is required to retrieve deb packages served over HTTPS:

        sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

3.  Add the APT repository information to your server's list of sources:

        echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic.list

4.  Update the list of available packages:

        sudo apt-get update

5.  Install the `elasticsearch` package:

        sudo apt-get install -y elasticsearch

6.  Set the JVM heap size to approximately half of your server's available memory. For example, if your server has 1GB of RAM, change the `Xms` and `Xmx` values in the `/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options` file to `512m`. Leave the other values in this file unchanged:

    {{< file "/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options" conf >}}
-Xms512m
-Xmx512m
{{< /file >}}

7.  Enable and start the `elasticsearch` service:

        sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
        sudo systemctl start elasticsearch

8.  Wait a few moments for the service to start, then confirm that the Elasticsearch API is available:

        curl localhost:9200

    The Elasticsearch REST API should return a JSON response similar to the following:

    {{< output >}}
{
  "name" : "Sch1T0D",
  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "MH6WKAm0Qz2r8jFK-TcbNg",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.1.1",
    "build_hash" : "bd92e7f",
    "build_date" : "2017-12-17T20:23:25.338Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "7.1.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
{{</ output >}}

9.  To determine whether or not the service has started successfully, view the most recent logs:

        systemctl status elasticsearch
