## What is Spark?

Spark is a general purpose cluster computing system. It can deploy and run parallel applications on clusters ranging from a single node to thousands of distributed nodes. Spark was originally designed to run Scala applications, but also supports Java, Python and R.

![Install, Configure and Run Spark on top of a YARN cluster](/docs/assets/spark/spark-logo.png "Install, Configure and Run Spark on top of a YARN cluster")

Spark can run as a standalone cluster manager, or by taking advantage of dedicated cluster management frameworks like [Apache Hadoop YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html) or [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/).

## Before You Begin

1. Follow our guide on how to [install and configure a three-node Hadoop cluster](/docs/databases/hadoop/install-and-configure-hadoop-cluster) to set up your YARN cluster. The master node (HDFS NameNode and YARN ResourceManager) is called **node-master** and the slave nodes (HDFS DataNode and YARN NodeManager) are called **node1** and **node2**.

    Run the commands in this guide from **node-master** unless otherwise specified.

2. Be sure you have a `hadoop` user that can access all cluster nodes with SSH keys without a password.

3. Note the path of your Hadoop installation. This guide assumes it is installed in `/home/hadoop/hadoop`. If it is not, adjust the path in the examples accordingly.

4. Run `jps` on each of the nodes to confirm that HDFS and YARN are running. If they are not, start the services with:

       start-dfs.sh
       start-yarn.sh

> This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Download and Install Spark Binaries

Spark binaries are available from the [Apache Spark download page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html). Adjust each command below to match the correct version number.

1.  Get the download URL from the Spark download page, download it, and uncompress it.

    For Spark 2.2.0 with Hadoop 2.7 or later, log on `node-master` as the `hadoop` user, and run:

        cd /home/hadoop
        wget https://d3kbcqa49mib13.cloudfront.net/spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
        tar -xvf spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
        mv spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7 spark

2.  Add the Spark binaries directory to your `PATH`. Edit `/home/hadoop/.profile` and add the following line:

    **For Debian/Ubuntu systems:**

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /home/hadoop/.profile
      : ~~~ shell
        PATH=/home/hadoop/spark/bin:$PATH
        ~~~

    **For RedHat/Fedora/CentOS systems:**

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /home/hadoop/.profile
      : ~~~ shell
        pathmunge /home/hadoop/spark/bin
        ~~~

## Integrate Spark with YARN

To communicate with the YARN Resource Manager, Spark needs to be aware of your Hadoop configuration. This is done via the `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` environment variable. The `SPARK_HOME` variable is not mandatory, but is useful when submitting Spark jobs from the command line.

1. Edit the *hadoop* user profile `/home/hadoop/.profile` and add the following lines:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /home/hadoop/.profile
      : ~~~ shell
        export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/home/hadoop/hadoop/etc/hadoop
        export SPARK_HOME=/home/hadoop/spark
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/hadoop/hadoop/lib/native:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ~~~

2. Restart your session by logging out and logging in again.

3. Rename the spark default template config file:

       mv $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf.template $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf

4. Edit `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` and set `spark.master` to `yarn`:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
      : ~~~
        spark.master    yarn
        ~~~

Spark is now ready to interact with your YARN cluster.

## Understand Client and Cluster Mode

Spark jobs can run on YARN in two modes: *cluster* mode and *client* mode. Understanding the difference between the two modes is important for choosing an appropriate memory allocation configuration, and to submit jobs as expected.

A Spark job consists of two parts: Spark Executors that run the actual tasks, and a Spark Driver that schedules the Executors.

-  **Cluster** mode: everything runs inside the cluster. You can start a job from your laptop and the job will continue running even if you close your computer. In this mode, the Spark Driver is encapsulated inside the YARN Application Master.

-  **Client** mode the Spark driver runs on a client, such as your laptop. If the client is shut down, the job fails. Spark Executors still run on the cluster, and to schedule everything, a small YARN Application Master is created.

Client mode is well suited for interactive jobs, but applications will fail if the client stops. For long running jobs, cluster mode is more appropriate.

## Configure Memory Allocation

Allocation of Spark containers to run in YARN containers may fail if memory allocation is not configured properly. For nodes with less than 4G RAM, the default configuration is not adequate and may trigger swapping and poor performance, or even the failure of application initialization due to lack of memory.

Be sure to understand how Hadoop YARN manages memory allocation before editing Spark memory settings so that your changes are compatible with your YARN cluster's limits.

{:.note}
> See the memory allocation section of the [Install and Configure a 3-Node Hadoop Cluster](docs/databases/hadoop/install-and-configure-hadoop-cluster) guide for more details on managing your YARN cluster's memory.

### Give Your YARN Containers Maximum Allowed Memory

If the memory requested is above the maximum allowed, YARN will reject creation of the container, and your Spark application won't start.

1. Get the value of `yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb` in `$HADOOP_CONF_DIR/yarn-site.xml`. This is the maximum allowed value, in MB, for a single container.

2. Make sure that values for Spark memory allocation, configured in the following section, are below the maximum.

This guide will use a sample value of `1536` for `yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb`. If your settings are lower, adjust the samples with your configuration.

### Configure the Spark Driver Memory Allocation in Cluster Mode

In cluster mode, the Spark Driver runs inside YARN Application Master. The amount of memory requested by Spark at initialization is configured either in `spark-defaults.conf`, or through the command line.

**From `spark-defaults.conf`**

  - Set the default amount of memory allocated to Spark Driver in cluster mode via `spark.driver.memory` (this value defaults to `1G`). To set it to `512MB`, edit the file:

    {:.file-excerpt }
    $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
      : ~~~
        spark.driver.memory    512m
        ~~~

**From the Command Line**

  - Use the `--driver-memory` parameter to specify the amount of memory requested by `spark-submit`. See the following section about application submission for examples.

    {:.note}
    > Values given from the command line will override whatever has been set in `spark-defaults.conf`.

### Configure the Spark Application Master Memory Allocation in Client Mode

In client mode, the Spark driver will not run on the cluster, so the above configuration will have no effect. A YARN Application Master still needs to be created to schedule the Spark executor, and you can set its memory requirements.

Set the amount of memory allocated to Application Master in client mode with `spark.yarn.am.memory` (default to `512M`)

{: .file-excerpt }
$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
  : ~~~
    spark.yarn.am.memory    512m
    ~~~

This value can not be set from the command line.

### Configure Spark Executors' Memory Allocation

The Spark Executors' memory allocation is calculated based on two parameters inside `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`:

  - `spark.executor.memory`: sets the base memory used in calculation
  - `spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead`: is added to the base memory. It defaults to 7% of base memory, with a minimum of `384MB`

{:.note}
> Make sure that Executor requested memory, **including** overhead memory, is below the YARN container maximum size, otherwise the Spark application won't initialize.

Example: for `spark.executor.memory` of 1Gb , the required memory is 1024+384=1408MB. For 512MB, the required memory will be 512+384=896MB

To set executor memory to `512MB`, edit `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` and add the following line:

{: .file-excerpt }
$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
  : ~~~
    spark.executor.memory          512m
    ~~~

## How to Submit a Spark Application to the YARN Cluster

Applications are submitted with the `spark-submit` command. The Spark installation package contains sample applications, like the parallel calculation of *Pi*, that you can run to practice starting Spark jobs.

To run the sample *Pi* calculation, use the following command:

    spark-submit --deploy-mode client \
                   --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
                   $SPARK_HOME/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.2.0.jar 10

The first parameter, `--deploy-mode`, specifies which mode to use, `client` or `cluster`.

To run the same application in cluster mode, replace `--deploy-mode client`with `--deploy-mode cluster`.

## Monitor Your Spark Applications

When you submit a job, Spark Driver automatically starts a web UI on port `4040` that displays information about the application. However, when execution is finished, the Web UI is dismissed with the application driver and can no longer be accessed.

Spark provides a History Server that collects application logs from HDFS and displays them in a persistent web UI. The following steps will enable log persistance in HDFS:

1. Edit `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` and add the following lines to enable Spark jobs to log in HDFS:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
      : ~~~
        spark.eventLog.enabled  true
        spark.eventLog.dir hdfs://node-master:9000/spark-logs
        ~~~

2. Create the log directory in HDFS:

       hdfs dfs -mkdir /spark-logs

3. Configure History Server related properties in `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
      : ~~~
        spark.history.provider            org.apache.spark.deploy.history.FsHistoryProvider
        spark.history.fs.logDirectory     hdfs://node-master:9000/spark-logs
        spark.history.fs.update.interval  10s
        spark.history.ui.port             18080
        ~~~

    You may want to use a different update interval than the default `10s`. If you specify a bigger interval, you will have some delay between what you see in the History Server and the real time status of your application. If you use a shorter interval, you will increase I/O on the HDFS.

4. Run the History Server:

       $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-history-server.sh

5. Repeat steps from previous section to start a job with `spark-submit` that will generate some logs in the HDFS:

6.  Access the History Server by navigating to http://node-master:18080 in a web browser:

    ![Screenshot of Spark History Server](/docs/assets/spark/spark-history-server-wide.png "Screenshot of Spark History Server")

## Run the Spark Shell

The Spark shell provides an interactive way to examine and work with your data.

1.  Put some data into HDFS for analysis. This example uses the text of *Alice In Wonderland* from the Gutenberg project:

        cd /home/hadoop
        wget -O alice.txt https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
        hdfs dfs -mkdir inputs
        hdfs dfs -put alice.txt inputs

2.  Start the Spark shell:

        spark-shell

        var input = spark.read.textFile("inputs/alice.txt")
        // Count the number of non blank lines
        input.filter(line => line.length()>0).count()

The Scala Spark API is beyond the scope of this guide. You can find the official documentation on [Official Apache Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html).
