The [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) relational database system is a fast, scalable, and standards-compliant open source database platform. This guide will help you install and configure PostgreSQL on Debian 5 (Lenny). We assume you've followed the steps detailed in our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/), and that you're logged into your Linode as root via SSH.

Installing PostgreSQL
---------------------

Make sure your package repositories and installed programs are up to date by issuing the following commands:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded

Issue the following command to install PostgreSQL, required dependencies, and some packages that provide additional functionality:

    apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

The current version of the database server will be installed, along with several supporting packages.

Configuring PostgreSQL
----------------------

### Installing the adminpack

This step is optional. Issue the following command to install the PostgreSQL `adminpack`, which provides additional functionality pertaining to remote management via tools like pgAdmin:

    su - postgres
    psql template1 < /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/adminpack.sql

You should see output similar to the following:

    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION
    CREATE FUNCTION

### Set the postgres User's Password

Change the `postgres` user's system account password with the following command. If you are already logged in as the `postgres` user, please issue the `exit` command first to return to a root shell.

    passwd postgres

Issue the following commands to set a password for the `postgres` administrative user. Be sure to replace "changeme" with a strong password. This password will be used to connect to the database via the network; ident authentication will be used for local connections made with `psql` while logged into a shell as the `postgres` user.

    su - postgres
    psql -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'changeme'" -d template1

### Creating a Database

Switch to the "postgres" user and create a database by issuing the following commands:

    su - postgres
    createdb mytestdb

Connect to the test database by issuing the following command:

    psql mytestdb

You should see output similar to the following:

    postgres@archimedes:~$ psql mytestdb
    Welcome to psql 8.3.7, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

    Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
           \h for help with SQL commands
           \? for help with psql commands
           \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
           \q to quit

    mytestdb=#

This is the PostgreSQL client shell; you may use it to issue SQL statements. To see a list of available commands, use the following command in the shell:

    \h

You may find more information on a specific command by adding it after the `\h` command.

### Creating Tables

To create a table in your test database called "employees", issue the following command:

    CREATE TABLE employees (employee_id int, first_name varchar, last_name varchar);

To insert a record into the table, you would issue a statement like this:

    INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Jack', 'Sprat');

To see the contents of the "employees" table, you would issue a SELECT statement similar to the following:

    SELECT * FROM employees;

This would produce output similar to the following:

    mytestdb=# SELECT * FROM employees;
     employee_id | first_name | last_name
    -------------+------------+-----------
               1 | Jack       | Sprat
    (1 row)

To exit the `psql` shell, issue this command:

    \q

### Creating PostgreSQL Users (Roles)

PostgreSQL refers to users as "roles", which may have different privileges on your databases. If a user is classified as a "superuser" it will have administrative access to the database system. To add a new user to PostgreSQL, issue the following command as the `postgres` user:

    createuser alison --pwprompt

You will be asked to specify several values for the new user. To delete this user, issue the following command:

    dropuser alison

By default, PostgreSQL uses `ident` authentication. This means database connections will be granted to local system users that own or have privileges on the database being connected to. Such authentication is useful in cases where a particular system user will be running a program (local scripts, CGI/FastCGI processes owned by separate users, etc). However, you may wish to change this behavior to require passwords. To do so, edit the file `/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf` as root or the postgres user. Find the following line:

    local   all   all   ident sameuser

Change it to the following to use password authentication:

    local   all   all   md5

Issue the following command as root to restart the database daemon and ensure that your changes have propagated:

    /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3 restart

To grant all privileges on the table "employees" to a user named "alison", issue the following commands as the `postgres` user:

    psql mytestdb

    GRANT ALL ON employees TO alison;

To use the database "mytestdb" as "alison", issue the following command:

    psql -U alison -W mytestdb

You will be prompted to enter the password for the "alison" user and given `psql` shell access to the database.
