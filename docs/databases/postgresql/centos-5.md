title: Use PostgreSQL Relational Databases on CentOS 5
---

The [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) relational database system is a fast, scalable, and standards-compliant open source database platform. This guide will help you install and configure PostgreSQL on CentOS 5. We assume you've followed the steps detailed in our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/), and that you're logged into your Linode as root via SSH.

Installing PostgreSQL
---------------------

Make sure your system is up to date by issuing the following command:

    yum update

Issue the following command to install PostgreSQL and required dependencies:

    yum install postgresql postgresql-server

The current version of the database server will be installed, along with several supporting packages. Start the database server with the following commands:

    /sbin/chkconfig --levels 235 postgresql on
    service postgresql start

Configuring PostgreSQL
----------------------

### Setting the postgres Password

Set a password for the "postgres" user by issuing the following commands (be sure to substitute your postgres password for "CHANGME" below):

    passwd postgres
    su - postgres
    psql -d template1 -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'CHANGEME';"

You should pick a password consisting of numbers, letters, and non-alphanumeric characters. As with other account passwords, it should be a minimum of eight characters in length.

### Creating a Database

Create a database and connect to it with `psql` by issuing the following commands:

    createdb mytestdb
    psql mytestdb

You should see output similar to the following:

    -bash-3.2$ psql mytestdb
    Welcome to psql 8.1.21, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

    Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
            \h for help with SQL commands
            \? for help with psql commands
            \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
            \q to quit

    mytestdb=#

This is the PostgreSQL client shell; you may use it to issue SQL statements. To see a list of available commands, use the following command in the shell:

    \h

To get help on a specific command enter it after `\h`, as shown below for the "SELECT" command:

    \h SELECT

### Creating Tables

To create a table in your test database called "employees", issue the following command:

    CREATE TABLE employees (employee_id int, first_name varchar, last_name varchar);

To insert a record into the table, you would issue a statement like this:

    INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Jack', 'Sprat');

To see the contents of the "employees" table, you would issue a SELECT statement similar to the following:

    SELECT * FROM employees;

This would produce output similar to the following:

    mytestdb=# SELECT * FROM employees;
     employee_id | first_name | last_name
    -------------+------------+-----------
               1 | Jack       | Sprat
    (1 row)

To exit the `psql` shell, issue this command:

    \q

### Creating PostgreSQL Users (Roles)

PostgreSQL refers to users as "roles", which may have different privileges on your databases. If a user is classified as a "superuser" it will have administrative access to the database system. To add a new user to PostgreSQL, issue the following command as the "postgres" user:

    createuser alison --pwprompt

You will be asked to specify several values for the new user. To delete this user, issue the following command:

    dropuser alison

By default, PostgreSQL uses `ident` authentication. This means database connections will be granted to local system users that own or have privileges on the database being connected to. Such authentication is useful in cases where a particular system user will be running a program (local scripts, CGI/FastCGI processes owned by separate users, etc). However, you may wish to change this behavior to require passwords. To do so, edit the file `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` as root or the postgres user. Find the following line:

{: .file-excerpt }
/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg\_hba.conf
:   ~~~
    local all all ident sameuser
    ~~~
Change it to the following to use password authentication:

{: .file-excerpt }
/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg\_hba.conf
:   ~~~
    local all all md5
    ~~~

As root, restart the Postgresql service:

    service postgresql restart

Resume these instructions as the `postgres` user:

    su - postgres

To grant all privileges on the table "employees" to a user named "alison", issue the following commands:

    psql mytestdb

    GRANT ALL ON employees TO alison;

To use the database "mytestdb" as "alison", issue the following command:

    psql -U alison -W mytestdb

You will be prompted to enter the password for the "alison" user and given `psql` shell access to the database.

Secure Remote Database Access
-----------------------------

PostgreSQL listens for connections on localhost, and it is not advised to reconfigure it to listen on public IP addresses. If you would like to access your databases remotely using a graphical tool, please follow one of these guides:

-   [Securely Manage Remote PostgreSQL Servers with pgAdmin on Windows](/docs/databases/postgresql/pgadmin-windows)
-   [Securely Manage Remote PostgreSQL Servers with pgAdmin on Mac OS X](/docs/databases/postgresql/pgadmin-macos-x)
