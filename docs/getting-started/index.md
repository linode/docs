## Sign Up

If you haven't already signed up for a Linode account, start here.

1.  Create a new account at the [Sign Up page](https://manager.linode.com/signup).
2.  Sign in and enter your billing and account information. Most accounts are activated instantly, but some require manual review prior to activation. If your account is not immediately activated, you will receive an email with additional instructions.
3.  Select a Linode plan and datacenter location:

    ![Available Linode plans](linode-manager-select-plan.png)

If you're not sure which datacenter to select, use our [speed test](http://www.linode.com/speedtest) to determine which location provides the best performance for your target audience. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for each of the datacenters to determine which of our facilities provides the best latency from your particular location.

## Provision Your Linode

After your Linode is created, prepare it for operation by setting up a Linux distribution.

### Log In to the Linode Manager

The [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com) is a web-based control panel that allows you to manage your Linode virtual servers and services. Log in with the username and password you created when you signed up. After you've created your first Linode, you can use the Linode Manager to:

* Boot and shut down your virtual server,
* Access monitoring statistics,
* Update your billing and account information,
* Request support and perform other administrative tasks.

### Deploy an Image

![How to Deploy an Image](deploy-an-image.gif "Animation shows how to use the Linode Manager to deploy a Linux image.")

Once you've created a new Linode, click the name or **Dashboard** to open the Linode Manager Dashboard.

1.  Click on **Deploy an Image** to reach the *Deploy* page.

2.  Select a Linux distribution from the **Image** menu. You can choose from:

    * [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/)
    * [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/)
    * [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/)
    * [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
    * [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/)
    * [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/)
    * [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/)
    * [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/)
    * [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

    If you're new to the Linux operating system, consider selecting Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Ubuntu is the most popular distribution among Linode customers and one of the most well-supported by online communities, so resolving any issues you may have should be simple.

3.  Enter a size for the disk in the **Deployment Disk Size** field. By default all of the available space is allocated, but you can set a lower size if you plan on cloning a disk or creating multiple configuration profiles. You can always create, resize, and delete disks later.

4.  Select a swap disk size from the **Swap Disk** menu.

5. Enter a root password for your Linode in the **Root Password** field. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. It must be at least 6 characters long and contain characters from two of the following categories:

    -   lowercase and uppercase case letters
    -   numbers
    -   punctuation characters

6.  Click **Deploy**. The Dashboard's Host Job Queue area will report the deployment progress in real time.

    {{< note >}}
Use a [StackScript](http://www.linode.com/stackscripts) to quickly deploy software platforms and system configuration options to your Linux distribution. Some of the most popular StackScripts do things like install the Apache web server, configure a firewall, and set up the WordPress content management system.
{{< /note >}}

## Boot Your Linode

Your Linode is now provisioned with the distro of your choice but it's turned off, as indicated in the Dashboard.

![Boot the Linode](boot-new-linode.gif "Click the Boot button, then OK in the dialog box.")

1.  Click **Boot** to turn on your Linode.

2.  When booted, the **Server Status** will change from **Powered Off** to **Running** and there will be a successfully completed **System Boot** job in the **Host Job Queue**.

## Connect to Your Linode via SSH

Communicating with your Linode is usually done using the secure shell (SSH) protocol. SSH encrypts all of the data transferred between the SSH client application on your computer and the Linode, including passwords and other sensitive information. There are SSH clients available for every operating system.

### SSH Overview

-   **Linux:** You can use a terminal window, regardless of desktop environment or window manager.
-   **Mac:** The *Terminal* application comes pre-installed with OS X and can be launched from *Applications* > *Utilities*.<!--- You could also use the free [iTerm 2 application](http://www.iterm2.com/). For a walk-through of connecting to your Linode for the first time **with OS X** (which also directly applies to Linux), see the following video: --->

  <!---  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVs9Ed-HkjE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->

-   **Windows:** There is no native SSH client, but you can use a free, open source application called [PuTTY](/docs/networking/ssh/ssh-connections-using-putty-on-windows/). <!--- For a walkthrough of connecting to your Linode in Windows using PuTTY, see the following video: --->

<!---    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eEsCD7n17mk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> --->

### Find your Linode's IP Address

Your Linode has a unique **IP address** that identifies it to other devices and users on the internet.

Find your Linode's IP address from the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com).

1.  Click the **Linodes** tab.
2.  Select your Linode.
3.  Click the **Remote Access** tab.
4.  Copy the addresses in the Public IPs section.

    [![Public IPs.](1711-remote_access_ips_small.png)](1710-remote_access_ips.png)

In this example, the Linode's IPv4 address is *96.126.109.54* and its IPv6 address is *2600:3c03::f03c:91ff:fe70:cabd*. Unless your internet service provider supports IPv6, use the IPv4 address.

### Log In

Once you have the IP address and an SSH client, you can log in via SSH. The following instructions are written for Linux and Mac OS X. If you're using PuTTY as your SSH client in Windows, follow [these instructions](/docs/networking/ssh/ssh-connections-using-putty-on-windows/).

![Copy SSH Command with IP and Log in](ssh-to-a-linode.gif "Go to the Remote Access tab and copy the SSH command, then paste it into a terminal.")

1.  Enter the following into your terminal window or application. Replace the example IP address with your Linode's IP address:

        ssh root@123.456.78.90

2.  If this is the first time connecting to your Linode, you'll see the authenticity warning below. This is because your SSH client has never encountered the server's key fingerprint before. Type `yes` and press **Enter** to continue connecting.

    {{< output >}}
The authenticity of host '123.456.78.90 (123.456.78.90)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 11:eb:57:f3:a5:c3:e0:77:47:c4:15:3a:3c:df:6c:d2.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
{{< /output >}}

    After you enter `yes`, the client confirms the addition:

    {{< output >}}
Warning: Permanently added '123.456.78.90' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
{{< /output >}}

3.  The login prompt appears for you to enter the password you created for the `root` user above.

    {{< output >}}
root@123.456.78.90's password:
{{< /output >}}

4.  The SSH client initiates the connection. When the connection is completed the following prompt appears:

    {{< output >}}
root@li123-456:~#
{{< /output >}}

    {{< note >}}
If you recently rebuilt an existing Linode, you might receive an error message when you try to
reconnect via SSH. SSH clients try to match the remote host with the known keys on your desktop computer, so when you rebuild your Linode, the remote host key changes.

To reconnect via SSH, revoke the key for that IP address.

For Linux and Mac OS X:

    ssh-keygen -R 123.45.67.89

For Windows, PuTTY users must remove the old host IP addresses manually. PuTTY's known hosts are in the registry entry:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\SshHostKeys
{{< /note >}}

## Install Software Updates

The first thing you should do after connecting to your Linode is update the Linux distribution's software. This applies the latest security patches and bug fixes to help protect your Linode against unauthorized access.

Installing software updates should be performed regularly.

### Ubuntu / Debian

    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

{{< note >}}
Ubuntu may prompt you when the Grub package is updated. If prompted, select `keep the local version currently installed`.
{{< /note >}}

### CentOS

    yum update

### Fedora

    dnf upgrade

### Arch Linux

    pacman -Syu

### Gentoo

    emaint sync -a

After running a sync, it may end with a message that you should upgrade Portage using a `--oneshot` emerge command. If so, run the Portage update. Then update the rest of the system:

    emerge --uDN @world

### Slackware

    slackpkg update
    slackpkg upgrade-all

## Set the Hostname

A hostname is used to identify your device in an easy-to-remember format. The hostname is stored in the `/etc/hostname` file. Your system's hostname should be something unique. Some people name their servers after planets, philosophers, or animals. Note that the hostname has no relationship to websites or email services hosted on it, aside from providing a name for the system itself. Your hostname should *not* be "www" or anything too generic. If you want to assign your system a fully qualified domain name, see our guide on using your system's [hosts file](/docs/networking/dns/using-your-systems-hosts-file/).

Once you're done, you can verify by running the command `hostname`.

### Arch / CentOS 7 / Debian 8 / Fedora / Ubuntu 16.04 and above

Replace `example_hostname` with one of your choice.

    hostnamectl set-hostname example_hostname

### Debian 7 / Slackware / Ubuntu 14.04

Replace `example_hostname` with one of your choice.

    echo "example_hostname" > /etc/hostname
    hostname -F /etc/hostname

### CentOS 6

Replace `hostname` with one of your choice.

    echo "HOSTNAME=example_hostname" >> /etc/sysconfig/network
    hostname "hostname"

### Gentoo

Enter the following commands to set the hostname, replacing `example_hostname` with the hostname of your choice:

    echo "HOSTNAME=\"example_hostname\"" > /etc/conf.d/hostname
    /etc/init.d/hostname restart

### Update /etc/hosts

The `hosts` file, located at `/etc/hosts`, creates static associations between IP addresses and hostnames, with higher priority than DNS. Open this file in a text editor and add a line for your Linode's public IP address. You can associate this address with your Linode's **Fully Qualified Domain Name** (FQDN) if you have one, and with the local hostname you set in the steps above. In the example below, `203.0.113.10` is the public IP address, `hostname` is the local hostname, and `hostname.example.com` is the FQDN.

  {{< file "/etc/hosts"  conf >}}
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
203.0.113.10 hostname.example.com hostname
{{< /file >}}

If you have IPv6 enabled on your Linode, you may also want to add an entry for your IPv6 address:

  {{< file "/etc/hosts" conf >}}
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
203.0.113.10 hostname.example.com hostname
2600:3c01::a123:b456:c789:d012 hostname.example.com hostname
{{< /file >}}

The value you assign as your system's FQDN should have an "A" record in DNS pointing to your Linode's IPv4 address. For Linodes with IPv6 enabled, you should also set up an "AAAA" record in DNS pointing to your Linode's IPv6 address. For more information on configuring DNS, see [Adding DNS Records](/docs/websites/hosting-a-website/#add-dns-records).

For more information about the `hosts` file and how to configure it, see [Using your System's hosts File](/docs/networking/dns/using-your-systems-hosts-file/)

## Set the Timezone

By default, your Linode will be set to UTC time. You may want to change this to the timezone you live in, or where a majority of your users live, to make log file timestamps more sensible.

### Debian / Ubuntu

    dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

### Arch Linux and CentOS 7

1.  View a list of available time zones:

        timedatectl list-timezones

2.  Use the `Up`, `Down`, `Page Up` and `Page Down` keys to navigate. Find the time zone you want. Remember it, write it down, or copy it as a mouse selection. Then press **q** to exit the list.

3.  Set the time zone:

        timedatectl set-timezone 'America/New_York'

### Gentoo

1.  View a list of available time zones:

        ls /usr/share/zoneinfo

2.  Write the selected time zone to the `/etc/timezone` file:

        echo "EST" > /etc/timezone

3.  Configure the `sys-libs/timezone-data` package, which will set `/etc/localtime` appropriately:

        emerge --config sys-libs/timezone-data

### Check the Time
