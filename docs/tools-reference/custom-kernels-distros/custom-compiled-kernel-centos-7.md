![Custom Compiled Kernel on CentOS](/docs/assets/custom-compiled-kernel-on-centos-7.png "Custom compiled kernel on CentOS")

Running a custom-compiled Linux kernel is useful if you need to enable or disable certain kernel features that are not available in Linode-supplied or distribution-supplied kernels. For example, some users desire [SELinux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux) support, which is not enabled in stock Linode kernels, and may not be enabled in some distribution-supplied kernels.

If you'd rather run a distribution-supplied kernel instead, please follow our guide for [Running a Distribution-Supplied Kernel](/docs/tools-reference/custom-kernels-distros/run-a-distribution-supplied-kernel-with-kvm).

Prior to these instructions, follow the steps outlined in our [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started/). Then, log in to your Linode as the `root` user.

## Prepare the System

1.  Update your package repositories and installed packages, install the development tools required for compiling a kernel, and install the `ncurses` library:

        yum update
        yum install -y ncurses-devel make gcc bc openssl-devel grub2

2.  Since some distributions install a pre-compiled kernel package into the `/boot/` directory along with their development package, avoid confusion later by removing any existing files there. **Warning**, this will delete everything within the `/boot/` directory _without_ asking for confirmation:

        rm -rf /boot/*

## Compile and Install the Kernel

### Download Kernel Sources

1.  Download the latest 4.x kernel sources from [kernel.org](http://kernel.org/). A conventional location to download to is `/usr/src/`.

        wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.7.tar.xz

2.  Expand the archived file and change directories:

        tar -xvf linux-4.7.tar.xz
        cd linux-4.7

### Configure the Kernel

The kernel must be properly configured to run within the Linode environment. Some required configuration options may include:

    CONFIG_KVM_GUEST=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI_LEGACY=y
    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD
    CONFIG_SCSI_VIRTIO=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET=y
    CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y
    CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y

We recommend that you start with a kernel configuration (config) from a running Linode kernel. All Linode kernels expose their configuration via `/proc/config.gz`. For example:

    zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
    make oldconfig

`make oldconfig` prompts the user to answer any new configuration options not present in the old configuration file.

Changes to the kernel's configuration can be made with the `menuconfig` command. Enable any additional options, making sure to leave filesystem support (likely ext3 or ext4) compiled into the kernel (*not* configured as a module). For example, to enable SELinux support, check the option "Security options --\> NSA SELinux Support" in the configuration interface.

    make menuconfig

Once your configuration options are set, exit the configuration interface and answer "y" for yes when asked whether you would like to save the new kernel configuration.

### Compile the Kernel

1.  Compile and install the kernel and modules:

        make bzImage
        make modules
        make
        make install
        make modules_install

    {: .note}
    > If you're using a Linode with multiple cores, you can use the `j` option to spawn multiple simultaneous jobs to increase speed. For example:
    >
    >     make -j2 bzImage

2.  Give the kernel a more descriptive name. Modify `vmlinuz-4.7-custom` in the command below to reflect the kernel version you've just compiled:

        mv /boot/vmlinuz /boot/vmlinuz-4.7-custom

3.  Create an `initrd` file. Again, adjust the filename to match the current kernel version:

        mkinitrd /boot/initrd-4.7-custom.img /boot/vmlinuz-4.7-custom

4.  Edit `/etc/default/grub` and add or change the following variables to match. There will be other variables in this file, but we are only concerned with those listed below:

    {: .file-excerpt}
    /etc/default/grub
    :   ~~~ conf
        GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
        GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty1 console=ttyS0,19200n8"
        GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=19200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"
        GRUB_TERMINAL="serial console"
        ~~~

    Comment or remove any lines starting with `GRUB_HIDDEN`.

5.  Make the `grub` directory and build your GRUB configuration file:

        mkdir /boot/grub
        grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

## Configure the Linode

1.  In the Linode Dashboard, click **Edit** next to your Configuration Profile (usually named after the version of Linux installed).

2.  Under **Boot Settings**, click on the **Kernel** drop-down menu, and select **GRUB2**:

    ![The GRUB2 Option.](/docs/assets/custom-kernel-grub2.png)

3.  Click **Save Changes**. You can now reboot the Linode. We suggest opening a [LISH](/docs/networking/using-the-linode-shell-lish) or [GLISH](/docs/networking/using-the-graphic-shell-glish) session first, so you can monitor the boot process and troubleshoot if necessary.


Note that if you install an updated kernel, you need to create a new `initrd` file, and update GRUB.

Congratulations, you've booted your Linode using a custom-compiled kernel!


{: .note}
> You may need to run `cp /boot/grub/unicode.pf2 /boot/grub/fonts/` for the boot menu to properly display in GLISH. Your Linode will still boot, assuming there are no configuration issues, without this command.
