description: "While the Linode Platform provides minimalist distribution templates and kernels complied to support the Linode's infrastructure explicitly, it is possible to deploy custom distributions and kernels within the context of the Linode Platform. These documents explore booting into a kernel of your choosing, and the procedure for creating and uploading custom distributions to run in your Linode instance."
