title: Manipulate Lists with sort and uniq
---

The Linux utilities `sort` and `uniq` are useful for ordering and manipulating data in text files and as part of shell scripting. The `sort` command takes a list of items and sorts them alphabetically and numerically. The `uniq` command takes a list of items and removes adjacent duplicate lines. Though narrow in their focus, both of these tools are useful in a number of different command line operations.

## Usage

### sort

The `sort` command accepts input from a text file or standard output and outputs the lines of the input sorted. Sorted text is sent to standard output and printed on the terminal unless redirected. `sort` commands take the following format:

    sort ~/roster.txt

`sort` also accepts input from other commands as in the following example:

    grep -i "retired" ~/roster.txt | sort

This uses [grep](/docs/tools-reference/search-and-filter-text-with-grep) to filter the `~/roster.txt` file for the string `retired`, regardless of case. These results are sent to `sort`, which reorders this output alphabetically.

In the default configuration, this `sort` prints the output on the terminal. To write this content to a file, redirect the output as in the following example:

    grep -i "retired" ~/roster.txt | sort > ~/retired-roster.txt

Here, the sorted output is written to the `~/retired-roster.txt` file.

### uniq

The `uniq` command takes input and removes repeated lines in a file or input. Because `uniq` only removes identical adjacent lines, it is often used in conjunction with `sort` to remove non-adjacent duplicate lines.

## Examples

### Reorder Lists with sort

Consider the following example:

    $ cat names-list.txt
    Richard Longly
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Beth Thompson
    Sarah O'Malley
    beth thompson
    Thompson Geller
    Bartram Miller
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    sarah o'malley
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith
    Erin Smith
    erin smyth
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor

    $ sort names-list.txt
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith
    Bartram Miller
    beth thompson
    Beth Thompson
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    erin smith
    Erin Smith
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Richard Longly
    sarah o'malley
    Sarah O'Malley
    Thompson Geller

Sort simply reorders the list alphabetically and outputs the sorted list to the standard output. Capital letters are ordered *after* lower case letters.

You can reverse the order of `sort` output with the `-r` option, as follows:

    $ sort -r names-list.txt
    Thompson Geller
    Sarah O'Malley
    sarah o'malley
    Richard Longly
    Michael Watts
    Michael Bitley
    Joni Governor
    Joni Governor
    Gil Watson
    erin smyth
    Erin Smith
    Erin Governor
    Earnest Quail
    Beth Thompson
    beth thompson
    Bartram Miller
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith

### Scramble List Order with sort

`sort` can scramble the order of lines using the `-R` option. Using the same example as above, consider the following output:

    $ sort -R names-list.txt
    beth thompson
    Richard Longly
    Beth Thompson
    Michael Watts
    Erin Smith
    Michael Bitley
    Bartram Miller
    Thompson Geller
    sarah o'malley
    Sarah O'Malley
    Erin Governor
    Earnest Quail
    Joni Governor
    Joni Governor
    Gil Watson
    erin smyth
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith

The "random" order is determined by using a cryptographic hash of the contents of lines, which produces a fast "scrambled" order. Identical lines are always printed adjacently to each other.

`sort` can scramble a list using the system's random number generator `/dev/random` or psudo-random number generator `/dev/urandom`. Consider the output of the following commands:

    $ sort -R names-list.txt --random-source=/dev/urandom
    Beth Thompson
    Erin Governor
    Richard Longly
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith
    Thompson Geller
    Joni Governor
    Joni Governor
    Earnest Quail
    erin smyth
    sarah o'malley
    Sarah O'Malley
    Erin Smith
    Michael Watts
    beth thompson
    Michael Bitley
    Bartram Miller
    Gil Watson

    $ sort -R names-list.txt --random-source=/dev/urandom
    erin smyth
    beth thompson
    Richard Longly
    Sarah O'Malley
    Joni Governor
    sarah o'malley
    Joni Governor
    Gil Watson
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Smith
    Erin Governor
    Michael Watts
    Michael Bitley
    Bartram Miller
    Beth Thompson
    Thompson Geller
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith

### Ignore Case when reordering with sort

The `-f` option for `sort` forces sort to ignore the case of a letter when ordering lines. The sorting algorithm used by `sort` is "unstable" in the default operation because lines judged to be identical may be printed out of order with regards to their original place. The effects of this are particularly apparent in this use case:

    $ cat names-list.txt
    Richard Longly
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Beth Thompson
    Sarah O'Malley
    beth thompson
    Thompson Geller
    Bartram Miller
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    sarah o'malley
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith
    Erin Smith
    erin smyth
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor

    $ sort -f names-list.txt
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith
    Bartram Miller
    beth thompson
    Beth Thompson
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    Erin Smith
    erin smyth
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Richard Longly
    sarah o'malley
    Sarah O'Malley
    Thompson Geller

    $ sort -fs names-list.txt
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith
    Bartram Miller
    Beth Thompson
    beth thompson
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    Erin Smith
    erin smyth
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Richard Longly
    Sarah O'Malley
    sarah o'malley
    Thompson Geller

### Remove Duplicate Lines with uniq

To remove duplicate adjacent lines in a file, send the output of `sort` to the `uniq` command, as in the following example (using the above example):

    %  sort names-list.txt| uniq
    Aaron Smith
    Bartram Miller
    beth thompson
    Beth Thompson
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    Erin Smith
    erin smyth
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Richard Longly
    sarah o'malley
    Sarah O'Malley
    Thompson Geller

The `-u` option for `sort` achieves the same result:

    $  sort -u names-list.txt
    Aaron Smith
    Bartram Miller
    beth thompson
    Beth Thompson
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    Erin Smith
    erin smyth
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Richard Longly
    sarah o'malley
    Sarah O'Malley
    Thompson Geller

### Ignore Case Differences when Removing Duplicate Lines with uniq

`sort` and `uniq` provide the ability to ignore case differences when dropping duplicate adjacent lines. The stability of the sorting method used can affect the final output generated. Consider the following examples:

    $ sort names-list.txt | uniq -i
    Aaron Smith
    Bartram Miller
    beth thompson
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    Erin Smith
    erin smyth
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Richard Longly
    sarah o'malley
    Thompson Geller

    $ sort -fs names-list.txt | uniq -i
    Aaron Smith
    Bartram Miller
    Beth Thompson
    Earnest Quail
    Erin Governor
    Erin Smith
    erin smyth
    Gil Watson
    Joni Governor
    Michael Bitley
    Michael Watts
    Richard Longly
    Sarah O'Malley
    Thompson Geller

### Count the Number of Duplicate Lines with uniq

The `-c` option for `uniq` counts the number of occurrences of a line in a file. Consider the following example:

    % sort names-list.txt | uniq -ic
          2 Aaron Smith
          1 Bartram Miller
          2 beth thompson
          1 Earnest Quail
          1 Erin Governor
          1 Erin Smith
          1 erin smyth
          1 Gil Watson
          2 Joni Governor
          1 Michael Bitley
          1 Michael Watts
          1 Richard Longly
          2 sarah o'malley
          1 Thompson Geller

As above, you can combine the `-c` and `-i` options to ignore the case differences.

### Print Duplicate Lines with uniq

The `-D` option inverts the behavior of `uniq`, and prints only the duplicated lines, as follows:

    $ sort names-list.txt | uniq -iD
    Aaron Smith
    Aaron Smith
    beth thompson
    Beth Thompson
    Joni Governor
    Joni Governor
    sarah o'malley
    Sarah O'Malley

In cases like this, you may send the output of one `uniq` command through another `uniq` command. Consider the following:

    $ sort names-list.txt | uniq -iD | uniq -i
    Aaron Smith
    beth thompson
    Joni Governor
    sarah o'malley

    $ sort names-list.txt | uniq -D | uniq -i
    Aaron Smith
    Joni Governor
