## What is Cron?

Cron is a classic utility found on Linux and UNIX systems for running tasks at pre-determined times or intervals. These tasks are referred to as **Cron tasks** or **Cron jobs**. Use Cron to schedule automated updates, report generation, or check for available disk space every day and send you an email if it falls below a certain amount.

## How to Use Cron and crontab - The Basics

System Cron jobs exist as entries in the `/etc/crontab` file. Each job is described on a single line by defining a time interval, a user to run the command as, and the command to run. Cron can run any kind of script, command, or executable.

Below is the default system `crontab` file from Debian 9:

    # /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
    # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
    # command to install the new version when you edit this file
    # and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
    # that none of the other crontabs do.

    SHELL=/bin/sh
    PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

    # m h dom mon dow user  command
    17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
    25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /        cron.daily )
    47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /        cron.weekly )
    52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )

The first job in the Cron table is:

    `17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly`.

This means at 17 minutes past each hour, change directory to `/`, the root of the filesystem. Then, as the `root` user, run the `run-parts` binary to execute all jobs in `/etc/cron.hourly`.

Time intervals are denoted by numbers and operators filled in place of each asterisk in a Cron job's `crontab` line. From left to right, the asterisks represent:

-  **Minutes** specified as a number from 0 to 59.
-  **Hours** specified as numbers from 0 to 23.
-  **Days of the month**, specified as numbers from 1 to 31.
-  **Months** specified as numbers from 1 to 12.
-  **Days of the week**, specified as numbers from 0 to 7, with Sunday represented as either/both 0 and 7.

See [man crontab](https://linux.die.net/man/1/crontab) for more information.

### Add a Cron Job

1.  Open a `crontab` for your user in a text editor (`vi` in most distributions):

        crontab -e

    {{< note >}} To change the text editor used, add the environment variable to your `~/.bashrc` file, exchanging `vim` for `nano`, or whatever other terminal-based editor you prefer.

    export EDITOR=vim
{{< /note >}}

2.  Add the Cron job, save, and exit. The `crontab` will be saved in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`as a `crontab` specific to the user who created it. To later remove a Cron job from it, delete the line from the user's `crontab` file.

### Special Cron Operators

Cron has additional operators to specify more complex time intervals. They are:

- `/` operator: "steps through" or "skips" specified units. Therefore `*/3` in the hour field, will run the specified job, at 12:00am, 3:00am, 6:00am, 9:00am, 12:00pm, 3:00pm, 6:00pm, and 9:00pm. A `*/3` in the "day of month" field, runs the given task on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, and 29th of every month.
- `,` operator: allows you to specify a list of times for repetition. Comma separated lists of times must not contain a space.
- `-` operator: specifies a range of values. `2-4` in the month field will run a task in February, March, and April. `1-5` in the day of week field will run a task every weekday.

### Special Cron Syntaxes

There are a number of special Cron schedule shortcuts used to specify common intervals. These are specified on the `crontab` entry in place of the conventional five column date specification. These special interval statements are:

- `@yearly` and `@annually` both run the specified task **every year** at 12:00am on the 1st of January. This is equivalent to specifying `0 0 1 1 *` in the `crontab` line.
- `@daily` and `@midnight` both run the cronjob **every day** at 12:00am. This is equivalent to the following `cron` syntax: `0 0 * * *`.
- `@monthly` runs the job **once a month**, on the 1st, at 12:00am. In standard `cron` syntax this is equivalent to: `0 0 1 * *`.
- `@weekly` runs the job **once a week** at 12:00am on Sunday. This is the same as specifying `0 0 * * 0` on the `crontab` line.
- `@hourly` runs the job at the top of every hour. In standard `cron` syntax this is equivalent to: `0 * * * *`.
- The `@reboot` statement runs the specified command once, at start up. Generally boot-time tasks are managed by the distribution's init system, but `@reboot` cronjobs may be useful for users who don't have access to edit systemd units or other init scripts.

## Run Jobs as Other Users

Cron can run tasks as other system users than just `root`. This is useful if you want to restrict the ability of a script to write to certain locations. For example, the command below allows you to edit the `crontab` for the `www-data` user:

    sudo crontab -u www-data -e

 While the ability to run jobs as system users is powerful, it can sometimes be confusing to manage a large number of `crontab` files dispersed among many system users. Also carefully consider the security implications of running a cronjob with more privileges than is required.

## Redirect Cron Job Messages

Cron will email the executing user by default with any output or errors that would normally be sent to the `stdout` or `stderr`. To disable email alerts, add `>/dev/null` to the end of the job's line in your `crontab` file.

For example, the full line would be:

    @hourly /opt/bin/job >/dev/null

That will only ignore messages sent to `stdout`. If your script generates an error, Cron will still send it to your email.

If you want to disable all output, including error messages, use `>/dev/null 2>&1` instead. Be aware that redirecting all output to `/dev/null` causes you to miss important errors if something goes wrong. For example:

    @hourly /opt/bin/job >/dev/null 2>&1


## Example crontab Entries

The site [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) has a large number of Cron job examples. Below are some quick `crontab` entries to get you started.

- Run the `cal-update-daily` binary every day at at 12:01am (`1 0`).

        1 0 \* \* \* /opt/bin/cal-update-daily

- Run the `/opt/bin/payroll-bi-monthly` application at 4:45pm (`45 16`), on the 1st and 15th of every month (`1,15`).

        45 16 1,15 \* \* /opt/bin/payroll-bi-monthly

- Run the `compress-static-files` script at the beginning of every hour. This can be done in two different ways. Enter only one into your `crontab` file.

    **Option A**

        0 \* \* \* \* /opt/bin/compress-static-files

    **Option B**

        @hourly /opt/bin/compress-static-files
