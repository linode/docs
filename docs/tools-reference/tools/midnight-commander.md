## Introduction

![Midnight Commander](/docs/assets/midnight-commander-full-screen.png)

For beginners, it can be intimidating, time-consuming and sometimes even risky to manage files on their Linux servers from the command line. And even more experienced users, once they constantly have to deal with many files and directories, scattered in many different locations, might want to switch to some tools better suited for this job. One such tool is Midnight Commander, a *Text User Interface* (TUI) file manager. 

A text user interface tries to do the same thing that a graphical user interface (GUI) does on popular operating systems: help people interact with their system in a visually oriented way instead of typing commands. Since a TUI uses characters instead of individual pixels to draw elements on the screen, it doesn't look as fancy as a GUI but it achieves the same results, giving you windows, panels, menus and the ability to use a mouse to interact with objects.

## Before You Begin

{: .note}
>
> This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

There's no special requirement to install Midnight Commander and it works on all Linux distributions. But do keep in mind that running it as root is not a good idea unless you need to modify or delete files/directories owned by this user. In most cases, reading or copying objects owned by root doesn't require special privileges so try to run `mc` as a regular user.

The methods in this tutorial have been tested on Debian 9, also known as Debian Stretch. While this file manager should work in an almost identical fashion on all Linux distributions, they don't all package the exact same version (4.8.18 in this case). This may result in small behavioral differences on other operating systems, although the chances are small.

## Install Midnight Commander

The first thing to do is install the utility.

1. On Debian or Ubuntu we run:

    sudo apt-get install mc

2. On CentOS, the command is:

    sudo yum install mc

And that's all there is to it.

## Launch Midnight Commander

1. Starting the program is easy. You just type this at the command prompt:

    mc

2. By default, MC uses a blue background color and highlights important menu items. If you think it's tiring to your eyes or distracting you can try this:

    mc --nocolor

![Midnight Commander - No Color Mode](/docs/assets/midnight-commander-nocolor.png)

## Screen Elements and How to Interact with Them

1. You'll notice that the file manager is vertically split into two panels. The logic behind this is that copy and move operations are done from one place to another. At the bottom, you can see ten rectangles that contain some text like **Help**, **Menu**, **View**, etc. They are preceded by numbers. These numbers represent the function key you need to press to access those actions. For example pressing **F10** will quit the program and return you to your shell.

2. Also at the bottom, above those ten buttons, you'll see `your_user@your_hostname:~$`. This allows you to type commands in your current working directory. Try it now and type:

    touch test

After you press **ENTER** you'll see a new file appear in your active panel. Now let's delete it without typing any commands. Use the arrow keys, pressing **UP** or **DOWN** until the file named `test` is highlighted. Now press **F8**. A dialog box pops up and asks for confirmation. Press **ENTER**. If you ever press **F8** by mistake this gives you chance to cancel the action.

![Midnight Commander Delete Confirmation Dialog](/docs/assets/midnight-commander-delete-confirmation.png)

3. At the top of the screen, you can see a colored bar with some text within: **Left**, **File**, **Command**, **Options**, **Right**. These are drop-down menus that can be accessed by pressing **F9** and then navigating with your arrow keys. Try this: press **F9** and then the **DOWN** arrow key multiple times until **Tree** is highlighted. Press **ENTER**. The panel has now changed to tree view. 

4. You may have noticed that once you hit the **F9** key, some letters get highlighted, e.g. **C** in **C**ommand. These are keys that you can press to navigate the menus faster. Let's return to our previous view: press **F9** then **l** (L) and then **g** to get back to **File listing**. When an input field is selected, you will also have to keep **ALT** pressed down before pressing on the highlighted letter.

5. Another way to interact with the utility is through the use of shortcut keys, a combination of keys that pressed together allow you to quickly access specific actions. For example, try pressing **CTRL+O**. You'll notice this gets you back to your shell… or so it seems. This lets you focus on the command line, or see previous command output, while Midnight Commander runs in the background. You can quickly return to its interface by hitting the same key combination.

6. Some readers might be surprised by this last method to interact with the program: you can use your mouse pointer and click on interface elements. Try it now, experiment and click on some areas.
## Using the Two Panels to Work with Files and Directories

1. Let's learn how to navigate through the two vertical panels. You can switch between the left and the right one by pressing **TAB**.

2. Now let's close Midnight Commander by pressing **F10** and then type this in the terminal:

    cd /tmp && mc

This will ensure that both panels' working directory will be `/tmp`. This is a directory containing temporary files that will be deleted at next boot, so we can experiment freely here.

3. Let's create a directory by pressing **F7**. Name this `test`.

4. Use your arrow keys, navigate to `test` and press **ENTER** (normally, after creating a directory, this should already be highlighted).

5. Now let's make nine empty files here. Type the following in MC's command line:

    touch file{1..9}

6. Let's say you want to copy three files from `/tmp/test` to `/tmp`. Use the arrow keys to navigate to `file1` and once it's highlighted press **INSERT** three times. Pressing **F5** and then **ENTER** will copy all three files to the working directory opened in the opposite panel.

![Midnight Commander - Highlighting and Copying Files](/docs/assets/midnight-commander-highlighting-and-copying-files.png)

Alternative ways to make selections are: holding down **SHIFT** and then pressing **UP** or **DOWN** arrow key, ***** to inverse the selection, **-** to unselect all objects that match a pattern (e.g. typing `f*` will deselect every file or directory whose names start with "f"), **+** to select by pattern. In these patterns, "*" stands for zero or more characters while "?" stands for one character. So "f*e" would match "fe", "file", "fiiiile" or anything else starting with "f" and ending with "e". "a?c" would match "abc", "adc", "azc", but it won't match "ac"; there needs to be exactly one character between "a" and "c".

If you prefer to use the mouse then right clicking will make individual selections. Holding down the right click and dragging will select multiple entries.

7. Pressing **F4** will open a file in the operating system's default editor. On Debian you will usually get this output if you never used the editor before:

    Select an editor.  To change later, run 'select-editor'.
      1. /bin/nano        <---- easiest
      2. /usr/bin/mcedit
      3. /usr/bin/vim.basic
      4. /usr/bin/vim.tiny
    
    Choose 1-4 [1]: 

It's recommended you choose **2** here since `mcedit` integrates with Midnight Commander and is easier to use than `nano`. There's a large amount of functions you can access by pressing **F9** to activate the editor's menu. Press **F10** to exit the utility or **ESC** two times.

![Midnight Commander's Editor mcedit with Syntax Highlighting Active](/docs/assets/midnight-commander-mcedit.png)

Tip: a lot of actions can be cancelled in MC with a double tap on the **ESC** key.

## A Few Useful Tips and Tricks

1. You may have noticed that accessing the parent directory or "going up" one level can be a bit tedious as you have to scroll/navigate all the way up to the **/..** entry. There's a faster way to do this. Press **F9**, followed by **o** and then **p**. This will take you to **Panel options** where you can activate **Lynx-like motion** (highlight it and press space or click it with your mouse). With this on, you can now go up a directory by simply pressing your **LEFT** arrow key and enter a directory by pressing the **RIGHT** arrow key.

![Midnight Commander Panel Options](/docs/assets/midnight-commander-panel-options.png)

2. Another tool that can save you time is MC's user menu. Go back to `/tmp/test` where we created nine files. Press **F2** and bring up the user menu. Select **Compress the current subdirectory (tar.gz)**. After you choose the name for the archive, this will be created in `/tmp` (one level up from the directory being compressed). If you highlight the .tar.gz file and press **ENTER** you'll notice it will open like a regular directory. This allows you to browse archives and extract files by simply copying them (**F5**) to the opposite panel's working directory.

![Midnight Commander User Menu](/docs/assets/midnight-commander-user-menu.png)

3. A feature that you may need occasionally is finding out the size of a directory (actually the size of all the files it contains, to be more accurate). This can be done by highlighting the directory and then pressing **CTRL+SPACE**.

4. And what would a file manager be without a search feature. Go up in your directory tree until you reach the top level, `/`, called root directory. Now press **F9**, then **c**, followed by **f**. After the **Find File** dialog opens, type `*.gz`. This will find any accessible gzip archive on the system. In the results dialog, if you press **l** (L) for **Panelize**, all the results will be fed to one of your panels so you can easily browse, copy, view and so on. If you enter a directory from that list, you lose the list of found files but you can easily return to it with **F9**, **l** (L) then **z** (to select **Panelize** from the **Left** menu).

![Midnight Commander - Find File Dialog](/docs/assets/midnight-commander-find-file-dialog.png)

5. Managing files is not always done locally. Midnight Commander also supports accessing remote filesystems through SSH's *Secure File Transfer Protocol, sftp*. This way you can easily transfer files between servers. 

Press **F9**, followed by **l** (L), then select the **SFTP link** menu entry. In the dialog box titled **SFTP to machine** enter `sftp://your_user@203.0.113.0`. Replace `your_user` with the username you have created on the remote machine and `203.0.113.1` with the IP address of your server. This will work only if the server at the other end accepts password logins. If you're logging in with SSH keys, then you'll first need to create and/or edit `~/.ssh/config`. It could look something like this:

{: .file }
~/.ssh/config
:   ~~~ conf
    Host sftp_server
        HostName 203.0.113.1
        Port 22
        User your_user
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ~~~

You can choose whatever you want as the **Host** value, it's only an identifier. **IdentityFile** is the path to your private SSH key.

After the config file is properly setup, you can access your SFTP server by just typing the identifier value you set after **Host**, in the **SFTP to machine** dialog. So, in our example, we would have to enter `sftp_server`.

## Conclusion

Obviously, Midnight Commander has many more features than those presented here. The more you use it, the more proficient you'll get and you'll probably want to make a lot of customizations to the default settings. In such a case, it's a good idea to backup your settings by copying `~/.config/mc/` to your local computer. You can also clone these settings to other servers by copying them to the same location.
