## What is tail?

The `tail` command is a core Linux utility used to view the end of text files. You can also use **follow mode** to see new lines as they're added to a file in real time. `tail` is similar to the [head utility](/docs/tools-reference/tools/view-the-beginning-of-text-files-with-head), used for viewing the beginning of files.

## Syntax and Basic Usage

Tail uses the following basic syntax:

    tail example.txt

This will print the last ten lines of `example.txt` to standard output on the terminal. `tail` is useful for reading files such as logs, where new content is appended to the end of the file.

To view multiple files, specify their names as additional arguments or use a wildcard:

    tail example.txt example2.txt

  {{< output >}}
==> example.txt <==
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10

==> example2.txt <==
Line 1
Line 2
{{< /output >}}

View the end of all `.log` files in a directory:

    tail *.log

## Control the Length of tail Output

By default, `tail` will output the final ten lines of a file. To view more or fewer than ten lines, use the `-n [number]` option to control the number of lines that the `tail` command prints:

    tail -n 5 example.txt

{{< output >}}
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
{{< /output >}}

    tail example.txt -n 2
{{< output >}}
Line 9
Line 10
{{< /output >}}

## Follow Mode

With the `-f` option, `tail` operates in **follow mode**. Here, `tail` prints the final lines of a file, then watches for new additions to the end of the file. When new lines are added they are printed to the terminal, giving you a live feed of the end of the file.

`tail` will continue to follow a file until the user sends a break (e.g. `Control+c`) to the terminal. Additionally, if the file is deleted or renamed, `tail -f` will fail. Use the `-F` option to force `tail` to follow file names rather than file objects. This can prevent problems with [log rotation](/docs/linux-tools/utilities/logrotate) and other programs that may alter file names.

Follow mode is very useful when troubleshooting issues because it allows you to watch logs in real time.

### Filter with grep

`tail` can be combined with [grep](/docs/tools-reference/search-and-filter-text-with-grep) to filter the contents of a log file in real time. You can use this to track specific types of errors, such as 404 responses from an Apache web server:

    tail -F /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep "404"
