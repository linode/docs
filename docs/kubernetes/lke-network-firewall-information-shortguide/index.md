In an LKE cluster, both of the following types of workload endpoints *cannot* be reached from the Internet:

-   Pod IPs, which use a per-cluster virtual network in the range 10.2.0.0/16

-   ClusterIP Services, which use a per-cluster virtual network in the range 10.128.0.0/16

All of the following types of workloads *can* be reached from the Internet:

-   NodePort Services, which listen on all Nodes with ports in the range 30000-32768.

-   LoadBalancer Services, which automatically deploy and configure a NodeBalancer.

-   Any manifest which uses hostNetwork: true and specifies a port.

-   Most manifests which use hostPort and specify a port.

Exposing workloads to the public Internet through the above methods can be convenient, but they can also carry a security risk. You may wish to manually install firewall rules on your cluster nodes; to do so, [please see this community post](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/19155/securing-k8s-cluster). Linode is developing services which will allow for greater flexibility for the network endpoints of these types of workloads in the future.
