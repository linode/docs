A monitoring tool is a key application in a production server. Nagios is a popular tool that provides monitoring and alerting services for your servers, applications and services. Using Nagios and a wide variety of available plugins, you can keep track of the status of your critical services like HTTP, SSH and SMTP. In this guide, you'll learn how to install Nagios 4 on your Linode.

## Before You Begin

1.  In order to run Nagios on your Linode, follow the configuration steps for Ubuntu 14.04 from our [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started/).

2.  Install and configure a LAMP stack. Follow the [LAMP on Ubuntu 14.04](docs/websites/lamp/lamp-on-ubuntu-14-04) guide for instructions.

3.  Install Ubuntu updates:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

## Install Nagios

### Create Users and Groups

Create a user, `nagios`, and a distinct group, `nagcmd`. Add `nagios` and the Apache user, `www-data`, to the `nagcmd` group in order to run external commands on Nagios through the web interface:

    sudo useradd nagios
    sudo groupadd nagcmd
    sudo usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios && sudo usermod -a -G nagcmd www-data

### Build Nagios 4 from Source Code

The latest stable version of Nagios 4 is not available in Ubuntu's default repositories as of this writing. To install it, download and compile Nagios from the source code:

1.  Install dependencies:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential unzip openssl libssl-dev libgd2-xpm-dev xinetd apache2-utils

2.  In your web browser, go to [the Nagios Core DIY download page](https://www.nagios.org/downloads/core-stay-informed/). If you prefer not to register for updates, click **Skip to download**.

3.  Under **Nagios Core**, find the release that says **Latest stable release** under **Notes**, then copy the download link (e.g., `https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.1.1.tar.gz`) to your clipboard.

4.  Download and extract Nagios to your Linode using `wget` and `tar`, pasting the link from Step 2:

        wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.1.1.tar.gz
        tar -xvf nagios-4.*.tar.gz

5.  Move to the newly created directory:

        cd nagios-4.1.1

6.  Configure, compile and install Nagios:

        ./configure --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-command-group=nagcmd
        make all
        sudo make install
        sudo make install-init
        sudo make install-config
        sudo make install-commandmode


## Configure Nagios Web Interface

Now that Nagios is installed, we can configure its web interface. First, configure Apache:

1.  Make sure Apache has `mod_rewrite` and `mod_cgi` enabled:

        sudo a2enmod rewrite && sudo a2enmod cgi

    If `mod_rewrite` or `mod_cgi` were not already enabled, restart Apache:

        sudo service apache2 restart

2.  Copy the sample virtual host configuration Nagios provides to `sites-available`:

        sudo cp sample-config/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios4.conf

3.  Restrict the file's permissions:

        sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios4.conf

4.  Enable the new virtual host:

        sudo a2ensite nagios4.conf

5.  The web interface requires login. Create a `nagiosadmin` account and record the password assigned:

        sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

6.  Reload Apache

        sudo service apache2 reload

## Install Nagios Plugins

Nagios Plugins allow you to monitor services like DHCP, FTP, HTTP and NTP. To use Nagios Plugins, go to [the Nagios Plugins downloads page](https://nagios-plugins.org/downloads/) and copy the download link for the current stable release (e.g., `http://www.nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.1.1.tar.gz`):

1.  Download and extract Nagios Plugins to your Linode using `wget` and `tar`, pasting the link you copied:

        wget http://www.nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.1.1.tar.gz
        tar -xvf nagios-plugins-2*.tar.gz

2.  As you did with Nagios, build the Nagios Plugins. Change to the newly created directory:

        cd nagios-plugins-2.1.1

3.  Configure, compile, and install Plugins:

        ./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-openssl
        make
        sudo make install

## Access the Nagios Web Interface

1.  Before you can access the Nagios Web Interface, you need to start the Nagios service:

        sudo service nagios start

    The interface can be accessed in your web browser by appending `/nagios` to your domain or Public IP. When prompted at login, use `nagiosadmin` as the user and the password you assigned in the **Configure Nagios Web Interface** section. 

2.  You will be greeted with a screen like this one:

    ![Nagios 4 Greeting](/docs/assets/greeting_nagios4.png)

    To view monitoring status, click the **Hosts** link in the menu on the left. This screenshot shows a running Nagios server called `localhost`:

## Next Steps

Nagios contains numerous features that are beyond the scope of this document. Explore the Nagios administrative interface as well as the resources listed below to access more information regarding the setup and configuration of Nagios.

Congratulations on your new Nagios monitoring and notification system!
