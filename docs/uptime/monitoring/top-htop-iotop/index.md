Viewing a server's processor activity in real-time can aid in discovering and diagnosing any problems in CPU and memory usage. The `top` command is a Linux process manager that can assist with monitoring.

## Reading the Screen

[![The top screen](top-full-small.png)](top-full.png)

The `top` screen contains a variety of information regarding your server, beginning with the server's uptime, load average, and tasks status, located in the header.

![top screen heading](top-top.png)

1.  The first line contains the time, uptime, and load average values for the server. The **load average** is displayed over 1, 5, and 15 minutes to provide a better overall look at the load your server has undertaken. If there is a spike at one minute, but the load at the five- and fifteen-minute marks is maintained at a lower level, then consider a different response compared to when the load is consistently high through all time intervals.

    {{< note >}}
In order to properly read the load average section, be aware of how many CPU cores the Linode has. If there is one CPU core, then a load average of 1.00 means the server is at its capacity. This number increases to 2.00 on a Linode with 2 CPU cores, 4.00 with 4, etc.

A load of .70 for a Linode with 1 core is generally considered the threshold. Any higher than this, then reconfigure your resources or look into upgrading your plan.

2.  A list of **tasks** and their various states.

3.  The **CPU percentage**, including the user CPU time (`us`), system CPU time (`sy`), time spent on low-priority processes (nice time, or `ni`), idle time (`id`), time spent in wait for I/O processes (`wa`), time handling hardware interruptions (`hi`), time handling software interruptions (`si`), and time stolen from the virtual machine (steal time, or `st`).

4. The sever's **memory usage** in kilobytes.

5. The system's **swap usage** in kilobytes.

Following the heading section is a list of processes and related data:

![Top processes](top-processes.png)

-  **PID**: The process ID.

-  **USER**: The username of the task's owner.

-  **PR**: The task's priority, ranging from -20 to 19, with -20 being the most important.

-  **NI**: The *nice value*, which augments the priority of a task. Negative values increase a task's priority, while positive values decrease it.

-  **VIRT**: Virtual memory used, virtual memory being the combination of both RAM and swap memory.

-  **RES**: The resident size of non-swapped, physical memory in kilobytes (unless otherwise noted).

-  **SHR**: The shared memory size, or memory that could be allocated to other processes.

-  **S**: The processes status. Can be: Running (`R`), sleeping and unable to be interrupted (`D`), sleeping and able to be interrupted (`S`), traced/stopped (`T`), or zombie (`Z`). This ties in with the task list in the header.

-  **%CPU**: CPU percentage since last `top` update.

-  **%MEM**: Memory (RAM) percentage since last `top` update.

-  **TIME+**: Cumulative CPU time that the process and children processes have used.

-  **COMMAND**: Name of process.

## Commands

The `top` command offers a set of additional commands that can be used to enhance its use through sorting and locating information.

There are two types of commands that can be used in conjunction with `top`: Command-line options, and interactive commands that can be used while in the program.

### Command-Line Options
Command-line options can help organize and filter from the start of the program.

Important commands to know include:

-  **`-d[interval]`**: Sets the delay time that `top` uses to refresh the results.
-  **`-i`**: Toggles whether or not idle processes are shown.
-  **`-p[PID,PID]`**: Allows the user to filter `top` so only the defined processes are shown.
-  **`-u [username]`**: Filters by user.
-  **`-n[limit]`**: Sets `top` to run for a set amount of intervals before exiting.
-  **`-b`**: Runs `top` in batch mode, ideal for log files and for use in conjunction with other programs.

Used alongside one-another, these commands can prove especially useful. For example, if you want to log a set number of processes over a period of time, you can combine batch mode, the process ID filter, the delay setting, and the iteration setting to output the results you are looking for:

    top -b -p[PID] -d[interval] -n[limit]

For this example, the process ID is 2774, the delay is set to 10 seconds, and the interval is 2 cycles:

    top -b -p2774 -d10 -n2

Which outputs these results:

    top - 15:20:59 up 2 days,  1:14,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
    Tasks:   1 total,   0 running,   1 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
    %Cpu(s):  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.9 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
    KiB Mem:   1012584 total,   507792 used,   504792 free,    24720 buffers
    KiB Swap:   262140 total,        0 used,   262140 free,   245800 cached

      PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S  %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
     3774 mysql     20   0  356m  51m  10m S   0.0  5.2   1:54.01 mysqld

    top - 15:21:04 up 2 days,  1:14,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
    Tasks:   1 total,   0 running,   1 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
    %Cpu(s):  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.8 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.2 si,  0.0 st
    KiB Mem:   1012584 total,   507800 used,   504784 free,    24720 buffers
    KiB Swap:   262140 total,        0 used,   262140 free,   245800 cached

      PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S  %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
     3774 mysql     20   0  356m  51m  10m S   0.2  5.2   1:54.02 mysqld

### Interactive Commands

When run on its own, not in batch mode, `top` is interactive. You can use commands to filter through or toggle various options, alter settings, and even manipulate tasks.

Although there are a vast number of `top` commands, some of the more common ones to know include:

-  **`return` or `space`**: Instantly update screen.
-  **`d` or `s`**: Alter the delay time.
-  **`H`**: Show individual threads for all processes.
-  **`i`**: Toggles whether idle processes will be displayed.
-  **`U` or `u`**: Filter processes by the owner's username.
-  **`1`**: Toggles between CPUs/CPU cores. When it reads `%Cpu(s)` all CPUs are being considered. `%Cpu` followed by a number denotes a single CPU core.
-  **`L`**: Locate string.
-  **`<`, `>`**: Select sort field (from column names).
-  **`k`**: Kill a process. You will be prompted to enter the PID.
-  **`W`**: Write a configuration file. It will output the location of the file.
-  **`h`**: Open help file.
-  **`q`**: Quit.

## Additional top-like Programs

`top` can be used in conjunction with other similar programs that either offer different output results or provide a more intuitive experience.

### htop

The `htop` command is an alternative to `top`, offering an easier interface featuring color, mouse operation, the ability to scroll through processes (horizontally and vertically). It is overall more intuitive, although providing similar output as the regular `top` command.

To install:

-     For Debian/Ubuntu:

        apt-get install htop

-     For CentOS/Fedora:

        yum install htop

Run `htop` by entering:

    htop

The `htop` screen runs similar to `top`, but with scroll and mouse support, and a variety of menus that allow for more intuitive use. When a process is highlighted you can act on that process, such as pressing `k` (kill). To learn more regarding `htop` commands, press `h` to open its help menu.

### iotop

The `iotop` command tracks the input/output operations on a per-process basis. `iotop` must be run as root or with the `sudo` prefix.

To install:

-    For Debian/Ubuntu:

        apt-get install iotop

-     For CentOS/Fedora:

        yum install iotop

Run `iotop` by entering:

    iotop

To focus only on processes running, run it with the `--only` suffix:

    iotop --only

`iotop` also shares a number of command line options with `top` including: `-n`, `-b`, `-d`, `-u`, and `-p`, but is not interactive. To learn more about operating iotop, run `iotop -h` in your terminal.
