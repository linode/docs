Whether you need to watch basic usage stats or need more advanced functionality, these guides will help you deploy open source server monitoring solutions on your Linux cloud server. The [Linode Longview](/docs/platform/longview/longview) tool also offers system metrics and graphing, which can be used in conjunction with any of these monitoring tools, or with the [Linode Manager email alerts](/docs/uptime/monitoring-and-maintaining-your-server/#configuring-linode-manager-email-alerts) to keep an eye on your system.
