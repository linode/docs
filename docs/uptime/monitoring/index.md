Whether you need to watch basic usage stats or need more advanced functionality, these guides will help you deploy open source server monitoring solutions on your Linux cloud server. The [Linode Longview](https://library.linode.com/longview) tool also offers system metrics and graphing, which can be used in conjunction with any of these monitoring tools, or with the [Linode Manager email alerts](https://library.linode.com/monitoring-and-maintaining#sph_configuring-linode-manager-email-alerts) to keep an eye on your system.
