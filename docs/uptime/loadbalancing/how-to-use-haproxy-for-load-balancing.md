## What is HAProxy?

HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is a TCP/HTTP load balancer and proxy server that allows a webserver to spread incoming requests across multiple endpoints. This is useful in cases where too many concurrent connections over-saturate the capability of a single server. Instead of a client connecting to a single server which processes all of the requests, the client will connect to an HAProxy instance, which will use a reverse proxy to forward the request to one of the available endpoints, based on a load-balancing algorithm.

This guide will describe the installation and configuration of HAProxy for load-balancing HTTP requests, but the configuration can be adapted for most load-balancing scenarios. The setup is simplified from a typical production setup and will use a single HAProxy node with two web server nodes which will service the requests forwarded from the HAProxy node.

## Before You Begin

1.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services.

2.  Update your system:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

3.  This guide uses private IP addresses in the example configurations. Refer to our [Linux Static IP Configuration](/docs/networking/linux-static-ip-configuration) guide to add private IP addresses and internally network your Linodes.

> This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Installation

HAProxy is included in the package management systems of most Linux distributions:

- Ubuntu 17.04:

      sudo apt-get install haproxy

- Fedora 26:

      sudo yum install haproxy

## Initial Configuration

1.  Review the default configuration file at `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`, which is created automatically during installation. This file defines a standard setup without any load balancing:

    {: .file }
    /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    :   ~~~ conf
        global
            log /dev/log    local0
            log /dev/log    local1 notice
            chroot /var/lib/haproxy
            stats socket /run/haproxy/admin.sock mode 660 level admin
            stats timeout 30s
            user haproxy
            group haproxy
            daemon

            # Default SSL material locations
            ca-base /etc/ssl/certs
            crt-base /etc/ssl/private

            # Default ciphers to use on SSL-enabled listening sockets.
            # For more information, see ciphers(1SSL). This list is from:
            #  https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/
            # An alternative list with additional directives can be obtained from
            #  https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/?server=haproxy
            ssl-default-bind-ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS
            ssl-default-bind-options no-sslv3

        defaults
            log     global
            mode    http
            option  httplog
            option  dontlognull
            timeout connect 5000
            timeout client  50000
            timeout server  50000
            errorfile 400 /etc/haproxy/errors/400.http
            errorfile 403 /etc/haproxy/errors/403.http
            errorfile 408 /etc/haproxy/errors/408.http
            errorfile 500 /etc/haproxy/errors/500.http
            errorfile 502 /etc/haproxy/errors/502.http
            errorfile 503 /etc/haproxy/errors/503.http
            errorfile 504 /etc/haproxy/errors/504.http
        ~~~

    The `global` section defines system level parameters such as file locations and the user and group under which HAProxy is executed. In most cases you will not need to change anything in this section. The user **haproxy** and group **haproxy** are both created during installation.

    The `defaults` section defines additional logging parameters and options related to timeouts and errors. By default, both normal and error messages will be logged.

2.  If you wish to disable normal operation messages from being logged you can add the following after `option dontlognull`:

        option dontlog-normal

3.  You can also choose to have the error logs in a separate log file:

        option log-separate-errors

## Configure Load Balancing

When you configure load balancing using HAProxy, there are two types of nodes which need to be defined: frontend and backend. The frontend is the node by which HAProxy listens for connections. Backend nodes are those by which HAProxy can forward requests. A third node type, the stats node, can be used to monitor the load balancer and the other two nodes.

1.  Open `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` in a text editor and append the configuration for the front end:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    :   ~~~ conf
        frontend haproxynode
            bind *:80
            mode http
            default_backend backendnodes
        ~~~

    {: .note}
    >
    > Throughout this guide, replace `203.0.113.2` with the IP address of your frontend node. 192.168.1.3 and 192.168.1.4 will be used as the IP addresses for the backend nodes.

    This configuration block specifies a frontend node named **haproxynode**, which is bound to all network interfaces on port 80. It will listen for HTTP connections (it is possible to use TCP mode for other purposes) and it will use the back end **backendnodes**.

2.  Add the back end configuration:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    :   ~~~ conf
        backend backendnodes
            balance roundrobin
            option forwardfor
            http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Port %[dst_port]
            http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
            option httpchk HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:localhost
            server node1 192.168.1.3:8080 check
            server node2 192.168.1.4:8080 check
        ~~~

    This defines **backendnodes** and specifies several configuration options:

      - The `balance` setting specifies the load-balancing strategy. In this case, the `roundrobin` strategy is used. This strategy uses each server in turn but allows for weights to be assigned to each server: servers with higher weights are used more frequently. 
      Other strategies include `static-rr`, which is similar to `roundrobin` but does not allow weights to be adjusted on the fly; and `leastconn`, which will forward requests to the server with the lowest number of connections.
      - The `forwardfor` option ensures the forwarded request includes the actual client IP address.
      - The first `http-request` line allows the forwarded request to include the port of the client HTTP request. The second adds the proto-header containing https if `ssl_fc`, a HAProxy system variable, returns true. This will be the case if the connection was first made via an SSL/TLS transport layer.
      - `Option httpchk` defines the check HAProxy uses to test if a web server is still valid for forwarding requests. If the server does not respond to the defined request it will not be used for load balancing until it passes the test.
      - The `server` lines define the actual server nodes and their IP addresses, to which IP addresses will be forwarded. The servers defined here are **node1** and **node2**, each of which will use the health check you have defined.

3.  Add the optional stats node to the configuration:

    {: .file-excerpt }
    /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    :   ~~~ conf
        listen stats
            bind :32700
            stats enable
            stats uri /
            stats hide-version
            stats auth someuser:password
        ~~~

    The HAProxy stats node will listen on port 32700 for connections and is configured to hide the version of HAProxy as well as to require a  password login. Replace `password` with a more secure password. In addition, it is recommended to disable stats login in production.

4.  Here is the complete configuration file after modifications:

    {: .file }
    /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    :   ~~~ conf
        global
            log /dev/log    local0
            log /dev/log    local1 notice
            chroot /var/lib/haproxy
            stats socket /run/haproxy/admin.sock mode 660 level admin
            stats timeout 30s
            user haproxy
            group haproxy
            daemon

            mode    http
            option  httplog
            option  dontlognull
            timeout connect 5000
            timeout client  50000
            timeout server  50000

            http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
            option httpchk HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:localhost
            server node1 192.168.1.3:8080 check
            server node2 192.168.1.4:8080 check

        listen stats
            bind :32700
            stats enable
            stats uri /
            stats hide-version
            stats auth someuser:password
        ~~~

## Running and Monitoring

1.  Restart the HAProxy service so that the new configuration can take effect:

        sudo service haproxy restart

Now, any incoming requests to the HAProxy node at IP address 203.0.113.2 will be forwarded to an internally networked node with an IP address of either 192.168.1.3 or 192.168.1.4. These backend nodes will serve the HTTP requests. If at any time either of these nodes fails the health check, they will not be used to serve any requests until they pass the test.

In order to view statistics and monitor the health of the nodes, navigate to the IP address or domain name of the frontend node in a web browser at the assigned port, e.g., http://203.0.113.2:32700. This will display statistics such as the number of times a request was forwarded to a particular node as well the number of current and previous sessions handled by the frontend node.
