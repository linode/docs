Icinga (a Nagios fork) is an Open-Source network monitoring tool that used for monitoring critical services and systems over your premises. Icinga2 can check and monitor hosts in a network or it can verify network external protocols, such as the state of a HTTP server, a mail server a file share service or others. However, Icinga2 can be configured to monitor internal systems state and check the load, the memory, the disk free space or other internal parameters via Icinga agents deployed in every node that needs to me monitored. Icinga can also be configured to send notifications and alerts via e-mail or SMS to the system administrators defined in contacts.  Icinga is highly deployed in Linux on top of Apache web server, PHP server-side interpreted programming language and MySQL or MariaDB database. These components make what we know as the LAMP stack.


In this tutorial we’ll cover how to install and configure the latest version Icinga2 web monitoring tool in Debian 9.2 in order to monitor our network infrastructure. We’ll also cover how we can setup icinga2 to monitor remote hosts services, such as HTTP servers, via regular command checks and how to deploy Icinga2 agent-based services running on the nodes that needs to be monitored in order to securely collect internal nodes system information, such as memory consumption, the system load degree, number of running processes or other important internal system parameters.


## Prerequisites

-	A Debian 9 Linode VPS
-	Root account access via console or remotely via SSH service to your VPS or `sudo` root privileges for a local machine account
-	A mail service for sending mail alerts



### Initial System Configurations

Before deploying Icinga2 web monitoring application in your Linode VPS, first update the system by issuing the following command.


  `apt update`

  `apt upgrade`


Reboot the machine in order to apply kernel updates with the below command. 

`init 6`


Icinga2 network monitoring application needs a web server, such as Apache HTTP server, and a PHP pre-processing language interpreter gateway and a RDMBS database, such as MySQL/MariaDB to store information. Install Apache web server, PHP interpreter modules required by Icinga and MariaDB database backend in one-shot by executing the below command.

`apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php7.0 php7.0-xml php7.0-curl php7.0-ldap php7.0-cli php7.0-gd php7.0-intl php7.0-readline php7.0-xml php7.0-mbstring php7.0-json php7.0-opcache php7.0-mysql mariadb-server mariadb-client`



Next, open and edit the follwoin line in PHP configuration file to change PHP time zone setting. 

Backup and open the file for editing:

`cp /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.ini{,.backup}`

`nano /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.ini`



Search and update time zone variable in `php.ini` configuration file:

~~~
date.timezone = America/Phoenix
~~~



Replace the timezone value to match VPS geographical location. Consult PHP docs at the following link http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php to update time zone setting.




Finally, restart apache daemon to pick-up PHP changes by issuing the following command.

`systemctl restart apache2`



## Configure Icinga2 Databases

 
Log in to MariaDB database console and create Icinga2 database application.  Also create a user with a strong password to manage Icinga2 application database, by issuing the following commands. You should replace database name, user and password used in this example with your own database name and credentials.

`mysql –u root -p`
~~~
create database icingadb;
grant all privileges on icingadb.* to 'icinga_user'@'localhost' identified by 'strongpassword';
flush privileges 
exit
~~~

Next, create Icinga2 database that will be used to store web interface users and groups. To ease the database administration process you can use the same MySQL user account to manage both Icinga2 databases simultaneously (`icinga_user'@'localhost`)


`mysql –u root –p`
~~~
create database icinga_users;
grant all privileges on icinga_users.* to 'icinga_user'@'localhost' identified by 'strongpassword';
flush privileges 
exit
~~~


## Install Icinga2

The installation of Icinga2 will be done via Debian 9 Apt Package Manager tool which will be used to download and install the latest version of the application pre-compiled binaries from Debian 9 repositories. In order to install Icinga2 application and Icinga2 MySQL module for accessing MariaDB database backend, execute the below command.

`apt install icinga2 icinga2-ido-mysql`


During the installation of Icinag2 via Debian 9 repositories, you will be asked a series of question that will help you in setting-up the application. In the first question prompt select "Yes" configure and enable Icinga2 to use MySQL module.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/Picture1.png)


The next prompt select "No" in order to configure icinga2-ido-mysql without dbconfig-common option.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/Picture2.png)



### Install Icinga2 Web Interface

In order to manage Icinga2 engine via a web control panel interface or visualize the state of services and hosts status from browsers, you need to install Icinga2 web interface and Icinga2 command line utility packages by issuing the below command. This packages will be also pulled from Debian 9 repositories.

`apt install icingaweb2 icingacli`


Finally, before starting to set-up Icinga2 via its web interface, go ahead and install MySQL schema required Icinga2 database by executing the following command. Icinga2 MySQL database schema is can be found in `/usr/share/icinga2-ido-mysql/schema/` system path.

`mysql -u root icingadb -p < /usr/share/icinga2-ido-mysql/schema/mysql.sql`

Also, you need to open and edit Icinga2 MySQL IDO configuration file and add Icinga2 engine database credentials, as shown in the below excerpt. Use the credentials of the first created database from the earlier database creation step.

`nano /etc/icinga2/features-enabled/ido-mysql.conf`

`ido-mysql.conf` file excerpt:


~~~ conf
library "db_ido_mysql"

object IdoMysqlConnection "ido-mysql" {
  user = "icinga_user",
  password = "strongpassword",
  host = "localhost",
  database = "icingadb"
}
~~~


Finally, restart Icinga2 daemon to reflect changes and verify Icinga2 daemon engine status by issuing the below command.

`systemctl restart icinga2.service`

`systemctl status icinga2.service`


You need to also execute the following commands in order to create Icinga Web 2 log directory and add the proper file system permissions in order to grant Icinga2 group with write permissions to this system path.

`mkdir -p /var/log/icingaweb2/`

`chgrp -R icingaweb2 /var/log/icingaweb2/`

`chmod -R 775 /var/log/icingaweb2/`



### Configure Icinga2 via Web Interface

Before starting to configure Icinga2 via a web browser, first you need to generate an installation token by issuing following command. Write down this token key, because we’ll needed later to start the set-up via web interface.

`icingacli setup token create`

The output of this command should be something like:

`The newly generated setup token is: 4358c2c0d345673c`


To show the generated token in case you’ve forgotten or you haven’t noted yet, execute the below command.

`icingacli setup token show` 

The command output should be:

`The current setup token is: 4358c2c0d345673c`


Start Icinga2 confguration process by opening a browser and navigate your VPS IP address or domain name via HTTP protocol at the following address.

[http://your_VPS_IP/icingaweb2/setup](http://your_VPS_IP/icingaweb2/setup)


In the first installation stage, you will be asked to fill the token filed with the generated token from command line in order to start the installation process, as shown in the below screenshot. Add the generated toked copied to clipboard and press the Next button to continue the configuration process.

On the next screen, choose **Authentication Type = Database** and hit Next button to continue.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/7.png)


In the next step add the credentials need to access Icinga2 database created for storing web interface users and groups. First add the name of the MySQL database (add database information of the second database created earlier). Use `icingaweb_db` as a name for this resource and leave the Host, Port and Character set variables as default.  Also, don’t enable Persistent and SSL options and hit on **Validate Configuration button** to validate the database. After the database has been validated successfully, hit on Next button to continue to the next phase of Icinga2’s configuration process.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/8.png)

Next, define a name for database authentication backed (you can use the default value) and hit on Next button to continue, as illustrated in the below screenshot

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/9.png)



On the next screen, add a username with a strong password in order to log in to Icinga2 web interface and further manage Icinga2 engine and click on the Next button to continue the configuration process.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/10.png)


Next, adjust Icinga2 application and logging configurations by using the below settings:

-Check **Show Stacktraces**

-Storage Type = **Database**

-Logging Type = **File**

-Logging Level = **Error**

-File path = `/var/log/icingaweb2/icingaweb2.log`


Hit on the Next button to continue the set-up process.


![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/13.png)

The next configuration screen will present a summary of Icinga2 configuration will all configuration made until reaching this step. Review the information report and hit on Next button to continue further with the configuration process.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/14.png)


At the following installation screen, press on Next button to continue with setting-up Icinga2 engine monitoring module.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/15.png)


In the next setup screen add a name for Icinga2 Backend, select **IDO** as Backend Type and hit on Next button to continue.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/16.png)

Next, add Icinga2 engine database credentials in order to setup the IDO resource environment. After adding Icinga2 database credentials, hit on **Validate Configuration** button to validate Icinga2 Monitoring IDO Resource and, then, after the successfully validated message appears in the screen, hit on Next button to continue to next setup stage.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/17.png)


Next, configure Icinga2 Command Transport module with the below configurations and hit on Next button to continue the setup process.

-Transport Name = icinga2

-Transport Type = Local Command File

-Command File = `/var/run/icinga2/cmd/icinga2.cmd`


![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/18.png)

On the next screen configure the monitoring security environment variables in order protect eavesdropping sensitive information and hit the Next button to continue. You should be safe to continue with the default values provided by Icinga2.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/19.png)


The next configuration screen will display a detailed report with all configurations made until this step. A message will also show you that Icinga2 Monitoring module has been successfully configured. Review all the configurations made so far and hit on the Finish button to complete the setup process.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/20.png)


Finally, after the installation and setup-up process completes, a green message will inform you that Icinga Web 2 has been successfully set up. The only thing left now is to hit on the Login to Icinga Web 2 button in order to exit the setup process and log in to Icinga Web 2 login webpage.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/21.png)


Log in to Icinga Web 2 with the account credentials configured during the installation process and you will be directed to Icinga Web 2 Dashboard, where you should see the default services and VPS system resources that are currently monitored by Icinga2 engine.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/22.png)


## Secure Icinga Web 2 Interface Via TLS

To access Icinga2 monitoring application via HTTPS application protocol that will secure the traffic for your clients, issue the following command to enable Apache web server SSL module and SSL site configuration file. Also, enable Apache rewrite module in order to force users to visit the interface via HTTPS.

`a2enmod ssl rewrite`

`a2ensite default-ssl.conf`


Next, open Apache sites-enabled default configuration file located in `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/` directory and update the file with the following lines to enable URL rewrite rules.

`nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`


Insert the below lines of code after DocumentRoot statement as shown in the below excerpt.

~~~ conf
<Directory /var/www/html>
  AllowOverride All
  Require all granted
</Directory>
~~~


Finally, restart Apache daemon to apply the new configuration file and visit your domain name or your VPS IP address via HTTP protocol. Because you’re using the Self-Signed certificate generated by Apache, an error warning should be displayed in the browser. Accept the warning in order to continue and be redirected to Icinga Web 2 via HTTPS protocol.

`systemctl restart apache2`


[https://your_VPS_IP](https://your_VPS_IP)


Finally, to force visitors to browse Icinga Web 2 interface via HTTPS protocol, create a new `.htaccess` file in your web server document root path with the following content.

`nano /var/www/html/.htaccess`


`.htaccess` file excerpt:

~~~ conf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L] 
</IfModule>
~~~

That’s all! You have successfully installed, set-up and secured Icinga2 engine monitoring application and Icinga Web 2 Interface in Debian 9. 


### Monitor Remote Hosts via Simple Host Monitoring

In order to monitor a host and its external services via regular command checks, Icinga2 uses a mechanism that issues a ping command at regular time intervals against the server's IP address and also, using its internal built-in commands, regularly verifies the state of remote network services protocols, such as HTTP, SSH, SMTP, IMAP, POP or others. Icinga2 stores Host definitions in objects. These objects with their attributes used for applying rules for Service, Notification, Dependency and Scheduled Downtime can be found in `hosts.conf` file, which can be located in `/etc/icinga2/conf.d/` directory. To add a new host definition in order to be periodically monitored by Icinga2 engine via ICMP checks, to determine if the host is online, open `hosts.conf` configuration file for editing and add the following lines add the bottom of the file.

`nano /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts.conf`


Icinga Host definition sample:

~~~ conf
object Host "WebServer VPS" {
  import "generic-host"
  address = "10.25.1.31"
  check_command = "hostalive"
}
~~~


Assuming that you want to check the status of a web server that runs in this node, add the following lines after host definition. The command will query the web server to determine if it's alive and replies with the correct HTTP exit codes.

~~~ conf
object Service "http" {
  host_name = " WebServer VPS"
  check_command = "http"
}
~~~

Finally, to apply the Host definitions and start periodically monitor the new host resource and the external web server, restart icinga2 daemon by issuing the following command.

`systemctl restart icinga2.service`

Verify the state of the new added host by navigating to **Overview -> Hosts** in Icinga’s Web 2 interface. In the right plane you should see the health status of the new added host. 


![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/23.PNG)

To display the status of the host’s HTTP service, navigate to **Overview -> Servicegroups** and click on HTTP Checks. In the right plane you should see health status of the external web service.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/24.PNG)



### Monitor Remote Hosts via Icinga2 Agent Monitoring
Icina2 can monitor nodes internal health parameters, such as CPU load, disk space, memory, number of running process via a secured channel setup between a master node and client node on port 5665/TCP. In this instance we’ll configure our Icinga2 to act as the master node and check the internal parameters health status of a remote client node, where a CentOS 7 server runs. In this specific type of configuration, also named Top Down Command Endpoint model, the check commands will be scheduled on the master node and then will be sent to the client via a TLS connection.  

First, we need to setup Icinga2 master node in our current Debian 9 server. Execute the below command to configure this instance of Icinga2 as a master node.

`icinga2 node wizard`


 Use the below command output excerpt to configure the master node:


<pre>

Now restart your Icinga 2 daemon to finish the installation!
</pre>

In order to apply the master node configuration, restart Icinga2 service and check daemon status by issuing the following commands.

`systemctl restart icinga2.service`

`systemctl status icinga2.service`


Also, issue ss command to output the port number of this master node and open the port in your Debian firewall.

`netstat -tulpn| grep icinga`


On the next step, generate a client ticket for your client node by issuing the following command. Use the *hostname* of your client to generate the ticket. In this example the client node hostname is `centos`. Replace the hostname of the client appropriately and make sure you run the command with `root` privileges.

`icinga2 pki ticket --cn 'centos'`


The command will generate and display a key. Make sure you copy or note down this key because you will need to setup the CentOS client later.


## Configure CentOS 7 Client Node

Now, log in to your CentOS 7 system with an account with `root` privileges or directly as root and issue the following command to enable EPEL and Icinga2 repositories in CentOS. Also, make sure your CentOS 7 system is configured with a static IP address.

`yum install epel-release`

`yum install https://packages.icinga.com/epel/icinga-rpm-release-7-latest.noarch.rpm`


Next, install Igina2 engine and Nagios plugins required by Icinga2 to execute the check commands in CentOS by issuing the following command.

`yum install icinga2 nagios-plugins-all`


After Icinga2 daemon has been installed in your CentOS system, start Icinga2 node wizard and configure this system as a satellite node instead of master node, by executing the below command.

`icinga2 node wizard`


 Use the below command output excerpt to configure CentOS 7 client node:

Done.

Now restart your Icinga 2 daemon to finish the installation!
</pre>


After the client node wizard completes, restart Icinga2 service, check Icinga2 service status, run `ss` command to list Icinga’s listening port and add the Icinga2 listening port number to CentOS firewall application, by issuing the below commands.

`systemctl restart icinga2`

`systemctl status icinga2`

`ss –tlpn|grep icinga2`

`firewall-cmd --add-port=5665/tcp --permanent`

`firewall-cmd --reload`

This last step completes the configuration on CentOS 7 Client node. 


## Setup Icinga2 Master Agent-based Monitoring
Now, go back to Icinga2 master node server console and create CentOS client zone directory and client configuration and services files by issuing the below commands.

`mkdir /etc/icinga2/zones.d/centos/`

`touch /etc/icinga2/zones.d/centos/centos.conf`

`touch /etc/icinga2/zones.d/centos/services.conf`

Next, open `centos.conf` zone configuration file for editing and add the following lines:

~~~ conf
object Zone "centos" {
  endpoints = [ "centos" ]
  parent = "icinga"
}

object Endpoint "centos" {
  host = "192.168.1.100"
}

object Host "centos" {
  import "generic-host"
  address = "192.168.1.100"
  vars.os = "Linux"
  vars.notification["mail"] = {
    groups = [ "icingaadmins" ]
  }
  vars.client_endpoint = name
}
~~~

The centos endpoint object zone will report back to its master node defined by `parent = “icinga”` statement.  Replace the CentOS hostname and IP address accordingly.



Now, open CentOS zone services configuration file and update the file as shown in the below excerpt:

`vi /etc/icinga2/zones.d/centos/services.conf`


`services.conf` file excerpt:

~~~ conf
apply Service "users" {
  import "generic-service"
  check_command = "users"
  command_endpoint = host.vars.client_endpoint
  assign where host.vars.client_endpoint
}

apply Service "procs" {
  import "generic-service"
  check_command = "procs"
  command_endpoint = host.vars.client_endpoint
  assign where host.vars.client_endpoint
}
~~~

 In this configuration file we’ve defined the following services checks for the remote client:  verify number of logged-in users to the system and the number of processes running in the system. The `command_endpoint` lines forces the service checks to be transmitted to the remote CentOS system and executed by Icinga2 engine command endpoint. You can add as many commands as you’d like here to be executed internally on the remote host. However, if Icinga sent instructions are not present on the remote node as Nagios plugin scripts, the commands won’t execute and an error should be displayed in icinga2 web interface.

Finally, to apply all the configurations made so far, restart icinga2 service and navigate to Icinga Web 2 interface to verify if the command checks are running on the remote node host. If the configuration is correctly configured you should see a list of internal parameters displayed for your remote client endpoint node.

![description](/docs/assets/icinga2/25.PNG)


That’s all! You have successfully configured Icinga2 as a master node and added a CentOS 7 machine client node to be remotely checked via Icinga2 agent-based monitoring system and another remote host to be actively monitored via external services command checks.
