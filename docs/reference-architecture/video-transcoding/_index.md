## Abstract

This reference architecture provides a concrete example of how to create a scalable, portable, and cost-effective media processing workflow. A traditional Video On-Demand (VOD) workflow is demonstrated in which a source video is output to an online distribution format. The prescribed architecture for this workflow can be cost-effectively scaled and extended to the formats required for your video transcoding use-cases. Some use-cases addressed by this workflow include:

- Supporting content for blogs or social media
- Producing video or digital assets for streaming services
- Embedding content in business applications

Review the [video transcoding architecture diagrams](/docs/reference-architecture/video-transcoding/diagrams/) for a high-level depiction of a general video transcoding workflow, as well as a more granular version which prescribes specific technologies to implement the workflow.

## Technologies Used

The workflow in this document is implemented on the [Akamai Connected Cloud](https://www.akamai.com/) (in particular, the [Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/)), Akamai CDN, and a GitHub Actions-powered CI/CD powered pipeline. The full accounting of technologies used includes:

## Business Benefits

- **Extensibility**: This reference architecture supports a myriad of media output format types and workflow step definitions. It can be configured to output to any device, platform, or audience specification.

- **Scalability**: This solution supports horizontal scalability by adding more Linodes within the Kubernetes cluster, which enables high throughput. Scaling this solution allows you to process a large amount of content in a short period of time. Scaling can support service launch or marketing campaign requirements.

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Traditional media workflows have to keep a deployed capacity for peak usage. This reference architecture is built on Kubernetes and uses the Argo workflow engine, which supports dynamic pod scheduling and tear-down. Because of this dynamic resource usage, your cost footprint can be minimized.
