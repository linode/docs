![Linode Writer's Formatting Guide](/docs/assets/linode-writers-formatting-guide.png "Linode Writer's Formatting Guide")

This guide provides templates and guidelines to use when creating or updating a guide for [Linode Docs](/docs).

Updates, improvements, and bug fixes to Linode documentation are always welcome through [GitHub](https://github.com/linode/docs) via pull requests (PRs) or issues.

We only accept new guides and authors through our guide submission process. To apply, please fill out the form on our [contribute page](/docs/contribute).

## General Layout

Linode Guides & Tutorials are written in [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/). Additional Linode-specific markdown formatting notes are given [further below](#markdown-formatting).

### Header

Linode Guides & Tutorials store metadata and other information in a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) header at the top of every page. Use the template below for your own guide.

    *This is a Linode Community guide. If you're an expert on something for which we need a guide, you too can [get paid to write for us](/docs/contribute).*

    ----

    ~~~

If you're updating an existing guide in our repository, you may also notice a `deprecated` field in the header. This defaults to false, and setting it to *true* inserts a pre-written message near the beginning stating that the guide is no longer maintained. Typically, this will be used on guides specific to applications or distributions that have reached End of Life (EOL).

### Introduction

Introductions should be concise; explain what the goal of the guide is and why. If you're introducing new software to the system, include a brief description and link to its official website whenever possible.

### Before You Begin

The *Before You Begin* section is an area for basic prerequisites a reader should know or have completed before proceeding further in your guide. Use the example below and edit as needed:

{: .file-excerpt}
Author Submission
:   ~~~
    ## Before You Begin

    1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

    2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do **not** follow the Configure a Firewall section yet--this guide includes firewall rules specifically for an OpenVPN server.

    3.  Update your system:

            sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    ~~~

#### Include a Note about Root or Non-Root users

{: .file-excerpt}
Guides Written for a Non-Root User
:   ~~~ txt
    {: .note}
    >
    > This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.
    ~~~

{: .file-excerpt}
Guides Written for a Root User
:   ~~~ txt
    {: .note}
    > The steps in this guide require root privileges. Be sure to run the steps below as `root` or with the `sudo` prefix. For more information on privileges, see our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.
    ~~~

#### Include a Note about Example Variables

If using example variables, like [example IPs](#example-ip-addresses), which should be changed throughout the guide, declare them in this section. For example:

    Replace each instance of `example.com` in this guide with your site's domain name.

### Paragraph Structure

Guides should be split into cohesive **sections** which flow from one sequence of events to the next. Each section title should be styled with an *H2* heading element, and each subsection with an *H3* heading so that scanning the *In This Guide* left sidebar should give the reader an overview of what will be done in the guide. Capitalize each noun, adjective, verb and adverb in the article title, H2 and H3 headers.

Each **subsection** should be split into numbered steps as shown below.

For example:

~~~
## Using MySQL

1.  Log in to MySQL as the root user:
        mysql -u root -p

2.  When prompted, enter the root password.

### Create a New MySQL User and Database

1.  In the example below, `testdb` is the name of the database, `testuser` is the user, and `password` is the user’s password.

        create database testdb;
        grant all on testdb.* to 'testuser' identified by 'password';

2.  Exit MySQL.

        exit

### Create a Sample Table

1.  Log back in as `testuser`:

        mysql -u testuser -p
~~~

{: .note}
>
>The tab size is set to four, and **only** soft tabs should be used. This can be configured in the settings of most text editors.

## Markdown Formatting

### Abbreviations and Acronyms

Upon first mention of a new concept or software, use the full name or term, then note the abbreviation or acronym in parenthesis beside it. The abbreviation/acronym can then be used in the article from that point. For example: Lightweight Resource/Provider (LWRP).

### Bold and Italics

Use a **Bold** font weight for buttons, menu selections and anything that requires emphasis or that you want to stand out to the reader. *Italicize* new terms and concepts the first time they are used.

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------|:------------|
| \*\*bold\*\* | **bold** |
| \*italics\* | *italics* |
|:--------------|:------------|

### Commands

Commands that are not inline with paragraph text should be indented one tab from the beginning of the copy.

For example:

    Update your system:

        yum update

>Update your system:
>
>     yum update

Inline commands should be denoted by backtics.

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Update your system by running \`yum update\`. | Update your system by running `yum update`. |
|:--------------|:------------|

### Example IP Addresses

Example IPs should use the documentation address blocks given in IETF [RFC 5737](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737). These are:

* 192.0.2.0/24
* 198.51.100.0/24
* 203.0.113.0/24

### External Resources/More Information

If you wish to provide links to external sites for the user to review after going through your guide, do so using the *external_resources* field in the [page header](#header). This will appear as a text block with links at the bottom of the page.

>More Information
>
>You may wish to consult the following resources for additional information on this topic. While these are provided in the hope that they will be useful, please note that we cannot vouch for the accuracy or timeliness of externally hosted materials.
>
>- [Link Title 1](http://www.example.com)
>- [Link Title 2](http://www.example.net)

### Files and File Excerpts

Use the *file* format when adding the content of a whole file to a guide. If only a part of the file is being shown, use the *file excerpt* format. Exceptionally long files should be shown in parts and have the whole file linked, if needed.

Within the file formatting, a code language or syntax should be defined at the end of the `:   ~~~` line to set how the text is displayed. A list of supported languages can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/tree/master/lib/rouge/lexers).

**Example**: File format

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| {: .file }<br>/path/to/file.html<br>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~ conf<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Sample file text<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample file syntax<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~ | <img src="/docs/assets/example_file_file.png"> |

**Example**: File Excerpt format

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| {: .file-excerpt }<br>/path/to/file.html<br>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~ ini<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Sample file excerpt text<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample file excerpt syntax<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~ | <img src="/docs/assets/example_file_excerpt.png"> |

### File Paths

Inline file paths should be unformatted text.

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Navigate to \`/var/www/html\`. | Navigate to `/var/www/html`. |
|:--------------|:------------|

### Headings

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| \#\# Section title (h2) | <font size="5">Section title (h2)</font> |
| \#\#\# Subsection (h3)   | <font size="4">Subsection (h3)</font> |

### Images

Images should be in *.png* or *.jpg* format. If an image is over 650 pixels wide, include both the original **and** one which is scaled down to 650 px. Image filenames cannot contain spaces and should use hyphens (-) to separate words instead of underscores (_).

When adding an image, ensure that all identifying attributes such as names and IP addresses are removed, obfuscated, or replaced with dummy text, such as **example_user** or **192.0.2.0**. Be mindful of metadata in images taken with mobile devices.


{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Up to 650 px wide. | Over 650 px wide. |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| \!\[description\](/docs/assets/filename.png) | \[!\[description\](/docs/assets/filename_small.png)](/docs/assets/filename.png) |

### Key Combinations

When instructing a reader to use a combination of keys, format the key combination in bold:

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Press \*\*CTRL+N\*\* then \*\*X\*\* to exit the program.  | Press **CTRL+N** then **X** to exit the program. |
|:--------------|:------------|

### Links

Internal links to other Linode guides should be relative, starting at `/docs/`, and external links should be formatted as shown below and use HTTPS URLs whenever possible.

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Internal | External |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| \[Getting Started\](/docs/getting-started) | \[Apache HTTP Server Documentation\](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/)] |

### Lists

Be sure that lists have the proper horizontal spacing. This should be *two* spaces for ordered lists and *three* for unordered. This is to keep the lists aligned properly with the four-space soft tabs used in the guides.

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Ordered |  Unordered |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| 1&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1.<br><br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2.<br><br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 3. | \*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1.<br><br>\*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 2.<br><br>\*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 3. |

### Notes and Cautions

Notes should be important text that does not necessarily fit the narrative of the preceeding step or paragraph. If a step in your guide can cause any major issues with the user's Linode or computer, a caution note should be included.

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| {: .note}<br>><br>> This is a sample note.<br> | <img src="/docs/assets/example-note.png"> |
| {: .caution}<br>><br>> This is a sample caution.<br> | <img src="/docs/assets/example-caution.png"> |

### Numerical Values

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| 1-10 | Greater than 10 |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Use words (one, two, three, etc.)  | Use numerical digits (11, 22, 33). |
|:--------------|:------------|

### Sentence Spacing

Use single spaces between sentences; do not double-space.

### Tables

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
  <thead><th>Formatting</th><th>Example</th></thead>
  <tr>
    <td>
{: .table .table-striped}
<br>
| Left-Aligned | Centered     | Right-Aligned |
<br>
| ---------------- |:-------------:| -----------------:|
<br>
| Columns,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | both&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| headers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br>
| and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | line items, | are aligned &nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br>
| by the hyphens | and colons | above. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
    </td>
    <td>
    <img src="/docs/assets/example-blue-stripe-table.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Variables

Variables that the reader will need to change for their system or preference should be formatted using backtics. Do not include any brackets or parentheses when using these temporary values in examples, as the reader may include them in their final version.

{: .table .table-striped .table-bordered }
| Formatting | Example |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Change the \`password\` and \`username\` values. | Change the `password` and `username` values. |
|:--------------|:------------|
