### Added:

- Users can now display their Linodes grouped by its tags.
- Users can import existing display groups from Linodes and Domains as tags from the dashboard.
    - For example; If a user were to have three Linodes in the display group "production", a new tag of "production" would be created and applied to those three Linodes.
- The existing display groups remain unchanged.

### Fixed:

- Linode chart statistics sometimes cause a crash.
- Viewing one StackScript, out of 1100, caused the application to crash. Gee thanks!
- URL encoded text was being injected into the search bar.
