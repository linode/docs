Our latest release includes updates that directly respond to Customer feedback. We have provided a way to view the activity for each Linode. This Activity stream, similar to the Host Job queue, will live on the Linode Summary page. This will present the last 5 items and an option to view more which will land you on the Activity tab to view all events for the Linode.

We will continue to build on this to support the level of detail that the Classic Manager's Host Job queue delivered.
