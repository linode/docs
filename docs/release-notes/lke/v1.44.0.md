title: Linode Kubernetes Engine v1.44.0
date: 2022-11-30
version: 1.44.0
---

### Added

- Adds support for [Kubernetes 1.24](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/kubernetes-1-24-release-announcement/).

    {{< note >}}
    The dockershim component was removed in upstream Kubernetes starting at version 1.24 (see [Dockershim Removal FAQ](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/02/17/dockershim-faq/)). The Linode Kubernetes Engine has kept this component installed on 1.24 LKE nodes in case any customer is reliant on that feature. When deploying a new LKE cluster using Kubernetes v1.24 (and later versions), the default container runtime has been changed to containerd.
