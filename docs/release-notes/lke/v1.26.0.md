### Added

- Add support for cluster-autoscaler to all LKE clusters. This feature is now live and configurable per node pool via the Linode API.

### Fixed

- Revert Calico CNI to host-local IPAM to address connectivity issues with the control plane. Any existing workloads still experiencing issues communicating with the control plane should be restarted so that Pods receive a new Pod IP address.
