### Changed

- Upgraded clusters using Kubernetes:
  - 1.27 to patch version [1.27.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md#v12711).
  - 1.28 to patch version [1.28.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.28.md#v1287).
- Adjusted `terminated-pod-gc-threshold`:
  - Details:
    - **Change**: The `--terminated-pod-gc-threshold` setting in the `kube-controller-manager` has been reduced from its default value to 500 pods.
    - **Context**: Previously, Kubernetes kept a large number of evicted and terminated pods. This could consume unnecessary resources and limit space for new pods.
    - **Impact**: When the count of evicted and terminated pods exceeds 500, the oldest pods (first by eviction timestamp, then by creation timestamp) are deleted to maintain the threshold. This helps reclaim resources and improve cluster performance.
  - **Resources**:
