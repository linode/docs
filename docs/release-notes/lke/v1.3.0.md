version: 1.3.0
---

### Added

- Added support for Kubernetes control plane versions 1.15.12, 1.16.11, 1.17.7. All clusters were upgraded to these versions
- Kubelet versions 1.15.10, 1.16.7, and 1.17.3 were made available for new and recycled Nodes

### Changed

- Allow patch version skew between control plane and kubelet, so that we can push kubelet upgrades asynchronously

### Fixed

- Deploy Linode Cloud Controller Manager v0.3.5 for all clusters to fix a bug with NodeBalancer config rebuild for LoadBalancer Services
