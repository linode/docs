### Added

- Added taxes to invoices and invoice items.
    - Added the *subtotal* and *tax* properties to invoices (GET /account/invoices/{invoiceId})
    - The *total* property of an invoice now represents the total of the invoice after taxes.
    - Added the *tax* and *total* properties to invoice items (GET /account/invoices/{invoiceId}/items).
    - An invoice item's *total* is the item's *amount* plus the taxes levied on the item.
- The Events endpoints (GET /account/events, GET /account/events/{eventId}) will now include Lassie reboots and reboots of a Linode's host.

### Fixed

- Reverted ability to filter StackScripts by image (introduced in release 4.0.19).
- Resizing (POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/resize) or upgrading (POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/mutate) a Linode will now throw an error if there is no availability in the Linode's data center.
- The *backups\_enabled* property of a Linode will now return true if a Linode's backups are temporarily paused by the Linode Support Team.
- Assigning a new credit card to an account (POST /account/credit-card) when the account has an expired credit card on file will no longer return an error.
