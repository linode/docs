### Changed

* Our new [Metadata](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/) service has completed its Beta phase and is now generally available to all customers!

  This new feature utilizes [cloud-config](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata-cloud-config/) to automatically configure and install software to compute instances when using the following commands:
  * **Linode Create** ([POST /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create))
  * **Linode Clone** ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-clone))
  * **Linode Rebuild** ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/rebuild](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-rebuild))

### Fixed

* **IP Addresses Assign** ([POST /networking/ips/assign](/docs/api/networking/#ip-addresses-assign))
  * Fixed a bug that allowed [shared](/docs/api/networking/#ip-addresses-share) IP addresses to be swapped between Linodes with this command, resulting in a Linode with the same IP address listed twice. Now, an error is thrown when trying to swap shared IP addresses between two Linodes.
