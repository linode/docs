### Added

- **IP Addresses List** ([GET /networking/ips](/docs/api/account/#users-list))

  - You can now drastically improve the performance of this command by utilizing the `skip_ipv6_rdns` option to exclude IPv6 RDNS data from responses. We recommend using this option if your application frequently accesses this command and does not require IPv6 RDNS data.
