### Changed

* [Linode Instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/) and their [Backups](/docs/api/linode-instances/backups-list/) now include the "available" read-only property which indicates whether a Linode's Backups are available for restoration. Backups that are undergoing maintenance are not available for restoration.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug that caused a Volume's `linode_label` to return as `null` in the response for **Volume Resize** ([POST /volumes/{volumeId}/resize](/docs/api/volumes/volume-resize/)) and for all Volumes beyond the first when attached to the same Linode for **Volumes List** ([GET /volumes](/docs/api/volumes/volumes-list/)). Now, `linode_label` always displays the correct value in responses for these commands.

* Fixed a bug that caused extra Configs to persist after accessing the **Linode Boot into Rescue Mode** ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/rescue](/docs/api/linode-instances/linode-boot-into-rescue-mode/)) command. Now, only the most recent rescue Config persists after booting into rescue mode.
