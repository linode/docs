### Changed

* [Linode Instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/) and their [Backups](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backups-list) now include the "available" read-only property which indicates whether a Linode's Backups are available for restoration. Backups that are undergoing maintenance are not available for restoration.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug that caused a Volume's `linode_label` to return as `null` in the response for **Volume Resize** ([POST /volumes/{volumeId}/resize](/docs/api/volumes/#volume-resize)) and for all Volumes beyond the first when attached to the same Linode for **Volumes List** ([GET /volumes](/docs/api/volumes/#volumes-list)). Now, `linode_label` always displays the correct value in responses for these commands.

* Fixed a bug that caused extra Configs to persist after accessing the **Linode Boot into Rescue Mode** ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/rescue](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-boot-into-rescue-mode)) command. Now, only the most recent rescue Config persists after booting into rescue mode.
