### Changed

- The VLANs List ([GET /networking/vlans](/docs/api/networking/#vlans-list)) beta endpoint description has been updated with the following:
    - Clearer instructions on how to detach a Linode from a VLAN.
    - A note that VLANs cannot be renamed.
    - A note that VLANs cannot be manually deleted. VLANs that are not attached to any Linodes are automatically deleted within a short timeframe.

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed that prevented `public` purpose VLAN interfaces that weren't configured for eth0 from working. This bug has been fixed, and the request body descriptions for the `purpose` property have been updated accordingly for the following endpoints:
    - Linode Create ([POST /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create))
    - Configuration Profile Create ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-create))
    - Configuration Profile Update ([PUT /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs/{configId}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-update))

- Previously, the Configuration Profile Update ([PUT /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs/{configId}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-update)) endpoint erroneously stated the `label` and `devices` properties as required and the `interfaces.purpose` property as optional. The `label` and `devices` properties are now stated as optional, while the `interfaces.purpose` property is now stated as required.
