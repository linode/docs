### Added

- Managed MongoDB and PostgreSQL Databases are now available! Commands for utilizing these new engines can be found in our [Managed Databases](/docs/api/databases/) documentation.

### Fixed

- Managed Databases now report an `updating` status, rather than `active`, while processing updates to a Database's `allow_list`.
