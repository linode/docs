### Changed

- Linode Disks can now be created from Account-specific ("private/") Images that a user has `read_only` or `read_write` access to with the Linode Create ([POST /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/linode-create/)) or Disk Create ([POST/linode/instances/{linodeId}/disks](/docs/api/linode-instances/disk-create/)) endpoints. Previously, only users with `read_write` access to an Account Image could create disks from that Image.

### Fixed

- A bug has been fixed that prevented filtering the Firewalls List ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/firewalls](/docs/api/linode-instances/firewalls-list/)) endpoint for the `created`, `id`, `label`, `tags`, and `updated` properties.
