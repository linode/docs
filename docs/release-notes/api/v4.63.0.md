title: API v4.63.0
date: 2020-04-15
version: 4.63.0
---

### Changed

- The [Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) (LKE) is out of Beta. All [LKE endpoints](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubernetes-clusters-list) now point to the `/v4` server instead of the `/v4beta` server.
  - **Note:** All `/v4` endpoints are available from the `/v4beta` server.

- The View Kubernetes API Endpoint  (GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/api-endpoint) has been removed from the API in favor of the List Kubernetes API Endpoints ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/api-endpoints](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubernetes-api-endpoints-list)) endpoint.

### Fixed

- A bug was causing LKE nodes in the process of being deleted to still appear as part of an LKE node pool. This bug has been fixed.
	- You can view an LKE clusterâ€™s node pools with the View Node Pool endpoint ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#node-pool-view)).
