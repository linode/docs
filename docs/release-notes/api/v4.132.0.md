title: API v4.132.0
date: 2022-07-25
version: 4.132.0

### Changed

- **StackScript Create** ([POST /linode/stackscripts](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscript-create))

    **StackScript Update** ([PUT /linode/stackscripts/{stackscriptId}](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscript-update))
    - StackScripts are now configurable to accept any and all available Image distributions by using the `any/all` value for a StackScript's "images".

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug regarding removal of VLAN interfaces from Linodes, which prevented certain functions such as migrating Linodes to regions that do not support VLANs.

- Fixed a bug where removing a Linode IP address failed to update any Managed Linode access settings that involved that IP address. Now, a Managed Linode's `ssh` properties are reset to their default values in this case. To view and configure Managed Linode SSH settings, use the **Linode's Managed Settings View** ([GET /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](/docs/api/managed/#linodes-managed-settings-view)) and **Linode's Managed Settings Update** ([PUT /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](/docs/api/managed/#linodes-managed-settings-update)) commands.
