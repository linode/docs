### Fixed

- The Maintenance List ([GET /account/maintenance](/docs/api/account/#maintenance-list)) beta endpoint previously returned information for inactive Linodes. This has been fixed to exclude information for inactive Linodes.

- The Domain Update ([PUT /domains/{domainId}](/docs/api/domains/#domain-update)) endpoint request body schema erroneously stated that the `domain` and `type` properties were required. The spec has been updated to mark these properties as optional.

- The Domain Create ([POST /domains](/docs/api/domains/#domain-create)) endpoint and Domain Update ([PUT /domains/{domainId}](/docs/api/domains/#domain-update)) endpoint SHELL request samples incorrectly stated a `display_group` property and excluded the `tags` property. The samples have been updated to state the `group` and `tags` properties.

- The following Domain schema properties have been updated to include the following missing value traits:
    - `domain`: minimum 1 and maximum 255 characters
    - `status`: a default value of active
    - `refresh_sec`: a valid, default value of 0, which is equivalent to 14400
    - `retry_sec`: a valid, default value of 0, which is equivalent to 14400
    - `expire_sec`: a valid, default value of 0, which is equivalent to 1209600

- The Account View ([GET /account](/docs/api/account/#account-view)) endpoint response body `balance_uninvoiced` description inaccurately stated that "Bandwidth charges are not included in the estimate." This has been corrected to state that "Transfer charges are not included in the estimate."
