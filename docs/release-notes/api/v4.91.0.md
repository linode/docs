### Changed

- The Linode VLANs feature has completed beta testing! All beta notices have been removed for endpoints involving VLANs, and VLANS List ([GET /networking/vlans](/docs/api/networking/#vlans-list)) requests are now accessible at `/v4` instead of `/v4beta`.

- The descriptions for the following Images endpoints were updated to improve accuracy and clarity:
    - Images List ([GET /images](/docs/api/images/#images-list))
    - Image Create ([POST /images](/docs/api/images/#image-create))
    - Image Upload ([POST /images/upload](/docs/api/images/#image-upload))

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed that caused 500 errors to return when empty request bodies or strings were submitted to the Firewall Rules Update ([PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId}/rules](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-rules-update)) beta endpoint. An error is now returned instead.
