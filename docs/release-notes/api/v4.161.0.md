### Added

* You can now utilize cloud-init with our new [Metadata](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/) service to automatically configure and install software to compute instance!

  When using the [Linode Create](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create) command, enter your [cloud-config](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata-cloud-config/) data as a base64-encoded string to the new `metadata.user_data` property.

  Compatible [Images](/docs/api/images/#images-list) can be determined by looking for `cloud-init` under the _new_ `capabilities` list.

  Compatible [Regions](/docs/api/regions/#regions-list) can be determined by looking for `Metadata` under the `capabilities` list.

  **BETA** This feature is in beta and is currently limited to certain Regions and distributions. Please be aware that this feature may receive breaking updates in the future.

* **Regions Availability List** ([GET /regions/availability](/docs/api/regions/#regions-availability-list))

  **Region Availability View** ([GET /regions/{regionId}/availability](/docs/api/regions/#region-availability-view))
  * You can use these new commands to view the availability of select premium and GPU compute instance types according to Region, which are currently in high demand. These commands may be expanded to cover additional compute instance types in the future.
