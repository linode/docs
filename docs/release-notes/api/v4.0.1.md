Added missing "resizing" Linode status.

### Fixed

* Fixed bug where Linodes got stuck in rescue mode.
* Fixed bug when attaching a Volume to a Linode with no configs.
* API now returns 500 when an IP Address cannot be allocated.
  * Previously, this incorrectly returned a 400.

  * Bug occurred when service was sent into this endpoint without `"type": "SRV"`.
* Fixed errors caused by illegal characters in URL errors.
