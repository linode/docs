### Added

- The `managed_issue` field was added to the Open Support Ticket endpoint ([POST /support/tickets](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)).
    - This field designates if the Support ticket is in reference to a [Managed Service](https://www.linode.com/products/managed/).
    - You must have a Managed Service enabled to use this designation.
    - No ID attributes (i.e. `linode_id`, `domain_id`, etc.) should be provided with this request.

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed that was preventing initiation of scheduled, cross data center migrations.

- If your Cloud Manager profile's authentication type is set to a Third-Party Authentication (TPA) method, `password_keys` can no longer be used as your `lish_auth_method` when updating your profile ([PUT /profile](/docs/api/profile/#profile-update)).
    - To view your Cloud Manager profile's `authentication_type` field, send a request to the [View Profile](/docs/api/profile/#profile-view) endpoint.

- Capital letters are now accepted for the `check_path` value when creating ([POST /nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#config-create)) and updating ([PUT /nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs/{configId}](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#config-update)) your NodeBalancer Configs.
