### Changed

- **Users List** ([GET /account/users](/docs/api/account/#users-list))

  **User View** ([GET /account/users/{username}](/docs/api/account/#user-view))

  **User Update** ([PUT /account/users/{username}](/docs/api/account/#user-update))

  - User `verified_phone_number` and `password_created` properties are now accessible when retrieving User data from these commands.

### Fixed

- **Backup Restore** ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups/{backupId}/restore](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backup-restore))

  - Fixed a bug that caused failed restorations when the target Linode itself was in the process of creating a Backup. Now, an error message is returned when this command is attempted under these conditions.
