### Added:

- Add filtering for StackScripts by image.
    - /stackscripts now accepts X-Filter for *images*.
- Increased PayPal max payments amount to $500 USD or credit card limit; whichever value is higher.
    - POST /account/payments/paypal enforces max amount for `usd` field.

### Fixed:

- Allow filtering on region by slug and slug alias.
    - /instances accepts X-Filter for *region* using data center slug or slug alias.
- Support ticket description and replies cannot contain only whitespace or newlines.
    - POST /support/tickets and /support/tickets/:id/replies disallow *description* field to contain only whitespace or new lines.
