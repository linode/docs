### Changed

- The Account View ([GET /account](/docs/api/account/#account-view)) endpoint response schema has been updated to include the `active_promotions.service_type` property which specifies the services to which a promotion applies.

### Fixed

- The Service Transfer Create ([POST /account/service-transfers](/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-create)) endpoint description incorrectly stated that Backups for transferred Linodes were not included in a transfer, and associated data would be removed/cancelled. This has been corrected to state that Backups are transferred with Linodes as well.

- Previously, the IPv6 SLAAC addresses for Linodes were incorrectly returned with /64 prefixes for endpoints such as Linode View ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-view)). This has been fixed so that Linode IPv6 SLAAC addresses are accurately returned with /128 prefixes.
