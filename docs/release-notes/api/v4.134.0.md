### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused all Disks on a Linode to return a "not ready" status if one of the disks was not ready.

- Fixed a bug that caused an error when attempting a [Linode Clone](/docs/api/linode-instances/linode-clone/) while below the limit of 5 concurrent clones. Now, the error only returns when attempting more than 5 concurrent clones of a Linode.

- Linodes that are in the process of [backup restoration](/docs/api/linode-instances/backup-restore/) can no longer be deleted.

- Previously, [assigning](/docs/api/networking/linodes-assign-ips/) an IP address off of a Managed Linode automatically set the [Managed Setting](/docs/api/managed/linodes-managed-settings-view/) "ssh.access" property to `false`. Now, assignment of a Managed Linode's IP Address does not affect its "ssh.access" setting.
