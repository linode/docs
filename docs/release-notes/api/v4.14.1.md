### Fixed

- Previously, when restoring from a backup ([POST
/linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups/{backupId}/restore](/docs/api/linode-instances/backup-restore/)) to a Linode that was smaller than the Linode that the backup was created for, disk space could be over allocated. A 400 error message was added to inform the user if they are attempting to restore a backup to a Linode that does not have enough unallocated space available, and over allocation caused by this bug is no longer possible.
