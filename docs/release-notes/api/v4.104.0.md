### Added

- Specify a Payment Method when accessing the Payment Make ([POST /account/payments](/docs/api/account/#payment-make)) endpoint by utilizing the new `payment_method_id` property.

### Fixed

- Previously, the specification erroneously stated that `google_pay` type Payment Methods could be added with the Payment Method Add ([POST /account/payment-methods](/docs/api/account/#payment-method-add)) endpoint. At this time, non-`credit_card` type Payment Methods can only be added using Linode Cloud Manager. The `google_pay` type has been removed from the endpoint's Request Body Schema accordingly.

- A bug was fixed that uploaded the SSH keys of deleted Users that were included in the `authorized_users` array when accessing the following endpoints:
    - Linode Create ([POST /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create))
    - Disk Create ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/disks](/docs/api/linode-instances/#disk-create))
