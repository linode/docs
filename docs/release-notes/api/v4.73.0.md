### Added

- Added the `BETA List Maintenance` ([GET /account/maintenance](/docs/api/account/#maintenance-list)) endpoint. This new beta endpoint allows you to view a collection of maintenance objects for any entity you have permissions to view. Currently, Linodes are the only entities available for viewing.

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed that would result in a 500 error when filtering domain records by a non-existent tag. This will now return a 200 response with an empty pagination result.
- Previously, NS and CNAME records could be created for each other, resulting in errors when the zone file is rendered. If this is attempted now, the record creation will fail with a "Record conflict" message.
- Changes were made to the ([GET /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linodes-list)) endpoint to improve response time.
