### Added

- [Linode Compute Instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/) now include the read-only `host_uuid` property. This UUID identifies the host machine of a compute instance, enabling potential failure point identification for applications running on multiple instances.

### Changed

- **Managed Service Create** ([POST /managed/services](/docs/api/managed/managed-service-create/))

    **Managed Service Update** ([PUT /managed/services/{serviceId}](/docs/api/managed/managed-service-update/))
    - The `address` property for Managed Services now has a limit of up to 100 characters.

- **Linodes Assign IPv4s** ([POST /networking/ipv4/assign](/docs/api/networking/linodes-assign-ipv/4s))
    - This command is now equivalent to **IP Addresses Assign** ([POST /networking/ipv4/assign](/docs/api/networking/ip-addresses-assign/)).

### Fixed

- [StackScripts](/docs/api/stackscripts/) are now filterable by `rev_note` in accordance to the documentation.
