### Fixed

- A bug was fixed to reject leading zeroes on ports set in Firewalls inbound and outbound rules. The following endpoints have been updated to reflect this new exclusion:

  - Firewall Create ([POST /networking/firewalls](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-create))
  - Firewall Update ([PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId}](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-update))
  - Firewall Rules Update ([PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId}/rules](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-rules-update))

- The Object Storage Object ACL Config Update ([PUT /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}/object-acl](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-object-acl-config-update)) endpoint previously specified the object `name` as a query parameter. This was corrected to specify the object `name` in the request body.

- The following endpoints were corrected to include `page`, `pages`, and `results` in their response objects:
  - User Logins List All ([GET /account/logins](/docs/api/account/#user-logins-list-all))
  - Logins List ([GET /profile/logins](/docs/api/profile/#logins-list))
