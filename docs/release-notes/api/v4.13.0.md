title: API v4.13.0
date: 2020-01-27
version: 4.13.0

### Changed

- Updated [OAuth section](/docs/api/account/#oauth-clients-list) with detailed private and public workflows.
- Updated `Create Kubernetes Cluster` ([POST /lke/clusters](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubernetes-cluster-create)) endpoint to include multiple node pools in the CLI code example.
    - Argument order is imperative. The arguments must be in sequential order `--node_pools.type [type]` followed by `--node_pools.count [count]` for each node pool.
    - You may add one or more node pool to each cluster.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with migrations and host information. If the migration is a disk, the `from_host` is the disk, if it's a clone, the `from_host` is the Linode. Users can see migration job information in the event endpoints:
  - `List Events` ([GET /account/events](/docs/api/account/#events-list))
  - `View Event` ([GET /account/events/{eventId}](/docs/api/account/#event-view))
- `+and`, `+or`, and `+order_by` filters for tags are now working.
- Longview will now retain more than 12 hours of statistics for users with the Pro plan.
- The `List Networking Information` ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/ips](/docs/api/linode-instances/#networking-information-list)) endpoint has been updated to only output IPv6 addresses for the specified Linode instead of all the IPv6 addresses for the customer.
