### Added

- Support Tickets for VLANs can now be opened. Accordingly, the following properties were added to the Support Ticket Open ([POST /support/tickets](/docs/api/support/support-ticket-open/)) endpoint:
    - `vlan`: The label of the VLAN this ticket is regarding, if relevant. Requires a specified `region` to identify the VLAN.
    - `region`: The [Region](/docs/api/regions/) ID for the associated VLAN this ticket is regarding. This property is only allowed when opening a VLAN ticket.

### Fixed

- Previously, submitting `ssl_cert` or `ssl_key` values with improper formatting resulted in a 500 error when using the NodeBalancers Config Update ([/nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs/{configId}](/docs/api/nodebalancers/config-update/)) endpoint. Now, an error message is returned if improperly formatted`ssl_cert` or `ssl_key` values are submitted with a request to this endpoint.
