### Added

- **Managed MySQL Database Backup Snapshot Create** ([POST /databases/mysql/instances/{instanceId}/backups](/docs/api/databases/#managed-mysql-database-backup-snapshot-create))
    - You can now create Database snapshot backups with this new beta command.

- **Managed MySQL Database Patch** ([POST /databases/mysql/instances/{instanceId}/patch](http://localhost:1313/docs/api/databases/#managed-mysql-database-create))
    - Update the underlying operating system of a Managed MySQL Database with this new beta command.

### Changed

- **Managed MySQL Database Create** ([POST /databases/mysql/instances](/docs/api/databases/#managed-mysql-database-create))
    - Managed MySQL Databases now include automatic patch updates, which apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed MySQL Database during configurable maintenance windows. These maintenance windows can be updated with the **Managed MySQL Database Update** ([PUT /databases/mysql/instances/{instanceId}](/docs/api/databases/#managed-mysql-database-update)) beta command.

- **IP Addresses Share** ([POST /networking/ips/share](/docs/api/networking/#ip-addresses-share))
    - This beta command has been re-enabled.

- **PayPal Payment Stage** ([POST /account/payments/paypal](/docs/api/account/#paypal-payment-stage))
    **Staged/Approved PayPal Payment Execute** ([POST /account/payments/paypal/execute](/docs/api/account/#paypal-payment-stage))
    - These endpoints have been disabled. PayPal can instead be designated as a Payment Method for automated payments using [Cloud Manager](/docs/guides/manage-billing-in-cloud-manager/#adding-a-new-payment-method).

### Fixed

- **Managed MySQL Database View** ([GET /databases/mysql/instances/{instanceId}](/docs/api/databases/#managed-mysql-database-view))
    - Fixed a bug preventing this command from executing for provisioning Databases.
