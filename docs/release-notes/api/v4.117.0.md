### Fixed

- **Linode Instances: Networking Information List** ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/ips/{address}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#ip-address-view))
    - Fixed a bug that returned any shared /56 or /64 IPv6 ranges, regardless of which Linodes the ranges were shared with.

- **Service Transfer Create** ([POST /account/service-transfers](/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-create))

    - **Service Transfer Accept** ([POST /account/service-transfers/{token}/accept](/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-accept))
    - Fixed a bug that allowed creating and accepting Service Transfers that included Linodes with shared IPv6 ranges.
