date: 2024-04-17
version: 4.174.0

### Added

Included new endpoints for VPC-related IP addresses:

- **VPC IP Addresses List** ([GET /vpc/ips](/docs/api/vpcs/#vpc-ip-addresses-list))
- **VPC IP Addresses View** ([GET /vpc/{id}/ips](/docs/api/vpcs/#vpc-ip-addresses-view))

### Updated

- **Networking Information List** ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/ips](/docs/api/linode-instances/#networking-information-list)). Added the `vpc` array that includes all VPC IP addresses for a specified Linode.
- **Updated operations that allow you to set a time to live (TTL)**. Values of 30 and 120 seconds are supported.

### Fixed

- Removed message for IPv6 beta support with VPC's when creating a Linode. (IPv6 is not supported.)
- **Disk Update** ([PUT /linode/instances/{linodeId}/disks/{diskId}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#disk-update__request-body-schema)). Only a disk's `label` can be updated with this operation.
- Replaced references of `none` to `null` for private Images, to address APIv4's multi-language support.
