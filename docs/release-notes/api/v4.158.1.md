### Fixed

- **Configuration Profile Update** ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs/{configId}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-update))

  - Fixed a bug that prevented other changes from taking effect when an empty `interfaces` parameter was included in the request for this command. Now, when an empty `interfaces` parameter is included with a request, all other changes to the configuration profile are also made.
