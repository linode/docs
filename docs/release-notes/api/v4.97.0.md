- The Maintenance List ([GET /account/maintenance](/docs/api/account/#maintenance-list)) beta endpoint is now filterable by the `when` property, allowing you to filter maintenance objects based on their date.

- LKE Node Pools are now taggable when using the Node Pool Create ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#node-pool-create)) and Node Pool Update ([PUT /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#node-pool-update)) endpoints.

- Profile referral data, including the referral code, is now only accessible after an Account has an established payment history when using the Profile View ([GET /profile](/docs/api/profile/#profile-view)) and Profile Update ([PUT /profile](/docs/api/profile/#profile-update)) endpoints.
