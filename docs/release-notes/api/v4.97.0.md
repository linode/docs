### Added

- Manage your Account's payment options with the new Payment Method Add ([POST /account/payment-methods](/docs/api/account/payment-method-add/)) endpoint.

- Promo Codes for new sign-ups can now be redeemed with the Promo Credit Add ([POST /account/promo-codes](/docs/api/account/promo-credit-add/)) endpoint. Previously, Promo Codes were entered only while signing up for a new account.

- You can now delete individual LKE Nodes with the new Node Delete ([DELETE /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/nodes/{nodeId}](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/node-delete/)) endpoint.

### Changed

- The Credit Card Add/Edit ([POST /account/credit-card](/docs/api/account/credit-card-addedit/)) has been deprecated. Please use the new Payment Method Add ([POST /account/payment-methods](/docs/api/account/payment-method-add/)) endpoint to manage your Account's credit card information.

- The Maintenance List ([GET /account/maintenance](/docs/api/account/maintenance-list/)) beta endpoint is now filterable by the `when` property, allowing you to filter maintenance objects based on their date.

- LKE Node Pools are now taggable when using the Node Pool Create ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/node-pool-create/)) and Node Pool Update ([PUT /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/node-pool-update/)) endpoints.

- Profile referral data, including the referral code, is now only accessible after an Account has an established payment history when using the Profile View ([GET /profile](/docs/api/profile/profile-view/)) and Profile Update ([PUT /profile](/docs/api/profile/profile-update/)) endpoints.
