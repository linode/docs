Citadel is a groupware suite that provides system administrators with an easy method to set up and manage email, calendars, mailing lists and other collaboration tools. It also features an automated installation process and versatile deployment options that allow the application to be scaled across multiple servers.

Before installing Citadel, it is assumed that you have followed our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/). If you are new to Linux server administration, you may be interested in our [introduction to Linux concepts guide](/docs/tools-reference/introduction-to-linux-concepts/), [beginner's guide](/docs/beginners-guide/) and [administration basics guide](/docs/using-linux/administration-basics).

This guide also assumes that you wish to run Citadel by itself on this server on port 80 or 443 for browser-based access. **Please note:** If you intend to install Citadel alongside another web server package such as Apache or nginx, select the "internal" option when asked about web server integration. Be sure to specify unique ports for Citadel such as 8080 for HTTP or 4343 for HTTPS.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before beginning the Citadel installation process, it is important that you satisfy a few prerequisites. Unless otherwise indicated, all steps should be performed as root.

### Configure Package Sources

You'll need to make sure the `universe` repositories are enabled in your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file. If necessary, uncomment or add them as follows:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/apt/sources.list
:   ~~~
    ## universe repositories
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic universe
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic universe
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic-updates universe
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic-updates universe

    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu karmic-security universe
    deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu karmic-security universe
    ~~~

Run the following commands to make sure your system is up to date:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded

### Set the Timezone

You will need to set the timezone of your server. Issue the following command:

    dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

If you're unsure of which timezone to use, you may wish to set this to your timezone or the timezone that the bulk of your users will be in. Additionally, you may want to use Universal Coordinated Time (also known as Greenwich Mean Time).

### Set the Hostname

You'll also need to set the hostname for your system. This can be any name you like, but it should be something that you will remember. In this example, the machine will be named "username".

    echo "username" > /etc/hostname
    hostname -F /etc/hostname

Now you will need to configure your Linode so that it associates its hostname with its public IP address. Edit the `/etc/hosts` file so that the first section resembles the following example. Replace `12.34.56.78` and `username.example.com` with your Linode's public IP and FQDN (name.domain.com).

{: .file }
/etc/hosts
:   ~~~
    127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
    12.34.56.78 username.example.com username
    ~~~
You're now ready to begin installing Citadel!

Installing Citadel
------------------

Begin by installing the `citadel-suite`, `spamassassin` and `amavisd-new` packages:

    apt-get install citadel-suite spamassassin amavisd-new

The installation process will prompt you to answer a couple of questions. Choose "0.0.0.0" for listen address, "No" for "Enable external authentication mode", and specify your admin username and password. Choose "Internal" for web server integration and enter "80" when asked the "Webcit HTTP port" question. Finally, choose your desired language. If you need to reconfigure any of these options later, you can use the following command:

    dpkg-reconfigure citadel-server

Enabling Spamassassin Filtering
-------------------------------

Edit the `/etc/mailname` file to reflect your system's domain name:

{: .file }
/etc/mailname
:   ~~~
    username.example.com
    ~~~

You'll need to edit the SpamAssassin configuration file to enable spamd:

{: .file }
/etc/default/spamassassin
:   ~~~
    # Change to one to enable spamd
    ENABLED=1
    ~~~

Start the spamassassin service as follows:

    /etc/init.d/spamassassin start

Please note that you'll finish enabling SpamAssassin support within Citadel later in the "Notes" section.

Running Citadel
---------------

Customize the logon banner for your Citadel server by editing the relevant file:

{: .file }
/usr/share/citadel-server/messages/hello
:   ~~~
    Citadel Groupware Server Login
    ~~~

Use the following startup script to initialize Citadel.

    /etc/init.d/citadel restart

Visit the web interface in your Web browser. Using our preceding example, the Web address to visit would look like:

    https://username.example.com

The SSL certificate for your Citadel web interface will be self-signed; accept it to continue. If you don't get a login page in your web browser, you may need to start "webcit" with the following command:

    webcit -d

Notes for Running Citadel
-------------------------

At this point, your email system should be fully functional and can be configured through the Webcit interface. When you log in for the first time as "Administrator", you will not need a password. However, it is recommended that you set a password as soon as possible under the "Advanced" tab.

To finish enabling SpamAssassin support, select "Administration" in the control panel. Next, click "Domain names and Internet mail configuration". Enter "127.0.0.1" in the box for the SpamAssassin host.

Lost Password Recovery
----------------------

If you lose the password to your administrator account, re-run the setup as follows:

    dpkg-reconfigure citadel-server

Specify a different name for the admin user and restart Citadel as follows:

    /etc/init.d/citadel restart

You should be able to log in as the new admin user with no password. You may then reset the password for your original administrator account. After this is done, log back in as the original administrator and delete the temporary admin account.
