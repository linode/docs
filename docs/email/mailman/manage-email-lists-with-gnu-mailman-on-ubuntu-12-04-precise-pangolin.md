GNU Mailman is a commonly used Listserv Management application that allows users to create and manage discussion and announcement email lists. Mailman includes support for numerous features including a web-based administrative interface, multiple domains, lists, and complex moderation and access control tools. The Mailman software is primarily written in the Python programing language and has been a popular choice for managing email lists for more than a decade.

Be sure to review this guide in its entirety before beginning the procedure outline below. If you have an existing mail system configured before you begin this, take special care to ensure that installing Mailman will not conflict with delivery of existing mail.

# Set the Hostname

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started/#setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

# Installing Mailman

Before proceeding with the installation of Mailman, make sure your package repositories and installed programs are up to date by issuing the following commands:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded

Mailman can be configured to use a number of different mail transfer agents. We recommend using the postfix MTA, though mailman will work with whatever MTA you have installed. If you do not have any MTA installed, issue the following command to install postfix:

    apt-get install postfix

During the postfix installation, you will want to select "**Internet Site**" as the "General type of mail configuration." You will also want to set the host or domain name for your server as the system name, (e.g. `example.com` or similar.) Now install Mailman with the following command:

    apt-get install mailman

During the Mailman installation, you will be required to specify the languages that you wish your Mailman instance support. Select all required languages before continuing. The installation process will also provide a note regarding the next step of the installation process, which you can accept and allow the installation process to continue.

# Configure Mailman

Consider the [Configure Virtual Hosting](/docs/email/mailman/manage-email-lists-with-gnu-mailman-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/#configure-virtual-hosting) section before preceding. In most cases where you will be hosting you will want to skip this section and continue with that procedure. Mailman requires a "base" list, from which it can send email to welcome new members to lists and send password reminders when needed. Create this list by issuing the following command:

    newlist mailman

During the list creation process, Mailman will prompt you for the administrators email address and an initial mailman password. Mailman will then produce the following output that you will want to include in your `/etc/aliases` file.

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/aliases" >}}
## mailman mailing list
mailman:              "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman post mailman"
mailman-admin:        "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman admin mailman"
mailman-bounces:      "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman bounces mailman"
mailman-confirm:      "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman confirm mailman"
mailman-join:         "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman join mailman"
mailman-leave:        "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman leave mailman"
mailman-owner:        "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman owner mailman"
mailman-request:      "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman request mailman"
mailman-subscribe:    "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman subscribe mailman"
mailman-unsubscribe:  "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman unsubscribe mailman"

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Press the return key to complete the installation and edit the `/etc/aliases` file as needed. After you've edited the `aliases` file issue the following command to inform postfix of these new addresses:

    postalias /etc/aliases

Now complete the installation process by initiating mailman for the first time:

    /etc/init.d/mailman start

At this juncture, you will be able to log into Mailman's web interface by visiting `http://example.com/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/mailman`, if your default virtual host is accessible at `example.com`. You can complete the configuration of Mailman by way of this web interface. To create a new list via command line, issue the following command where `team` is the name of the new list that you wish to create:

    newlist team

Mailman will generate a number of lines that you will want to append to your `/etc/aliases` file as shown above. Be sure to run the following command every time you modify `/etc/aliases`:

    postalias /etc/aliases

Users of your lists will be able to access a web-based interface to subscribe, view archives, and manage their subscription. For the "team" list created above, that interface would be located at: `http://example.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo`, where `example.com` represents your machine's default virtual host. Administrators will be able to access the administration interface for their lists by way of `http://example.com/cgi-bin/mailman/admin`.

If you have an existing email system configured or configured your email aliases with another configuration method, you may wish to continue reading for additional instructions on completing the setup of Mailman for alternate deployments.

# Configure Virtual Hosting

When constructing lists using the method described above, you must be careful to ensure that you have not created a list that will conflict with an existing user account or email alias. In smaller deployments this may not be an issue, however, as your Mailman instance begins to support a larger number of email lists, managing an `/etc/aliases` file can present a significant burden. For this reason we strongly recommend using a dedicated sub-domain for all Mailman administered listservs, such as `lists.example.com`.

Complete the following steps after installing `postfix` and `mailman` by way of `apt-get`. However, complete the following instructions before creating the initial "mailman" list. Begin by adding the following lines to the `/etc/postfix/main.cf` file:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/postfix/main.cf" >}}
relay_domains = $mydestination, lists.example.com
relay_recipient_maps = hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman
transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
mailman_destination_recipient_limit = 1

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Replace `example.com` and `lists.example.com` with the relevant domains for your instance. Ensure that you have configured the [MX Records](/docs/dns-guides/introduction-to-dns/#mx) for both domains that you want to receive email with. Additionally, ensure the following lines are included your `/etc/postfix/master.cf` file:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/postfix/master.cf" >}}
mailman   unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
flags=FR user=list argv=/usr/lib/mailman/bin/postfix-to-mailman.py
${nexthop} ${user}

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


These lines enable postfix to hand off email to Mailman for processing directly. Add the following line to the `/etc/postfix/transport` file, modifying `lists.example.com` as needed.

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/postfix/transport" >}}
lists.example.com mailman:

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Finally, modify the `/etc/mailman/mm_cfg.py` file to set the following values. After you've edited the `/etc/postfix/transport` file, and after every successive edit of this file, issue the following command to rebuild postfix's transport database:

    postmap /etc/postfix/transport

This controls how Mailman processes the mail that it receives from postfix. Continue configuring Mailman by editing following file to update Mailman to interact properly with postfix:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/mailman/mm_cfg.py" >}}
MTA = 'Postfix'
POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS = ['lists.example.com']
# alias for postmaster, abuse and mailer-daemon
DEB_LISTMASTER = 'postmaster@example.com'

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Ensure that the fields `DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST` and `DEFAULT_URL_HOST` match the sub-domain you are using for lists (e.g. `lists.example.com`) as follows:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/mailman/mm_cfg.py" >}}
#-------------------------------------------------------------
# Default domain for email addresses of newly created MLs
DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'lists.example.com'
#-------------------------------------------------------------
# Default host for web interface of newly created MLs
DEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'lists.example.com'
#-------------------------------------------------------------
# Required when setting any of its arguments.
add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


If you need to configure additional domains for use, ensure that you've made the proper additions to the `relay_domains` field in the to the `POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS` line and create additional `add_virtualhost` calls in the following form for every new domain:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/mailman/mm_cfg.py" >}}
add_virtualhost('lists.example.org', 'lists.example.org')

# Modify the following line
POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS = ['lists.example.com', 'lists.example.org']

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Ensure that your domains have valid MX and [A Records](/docs/dns-guides/introduction-to-dns/#types-of-dns-records) that point to your Linode. When you've finished configuring Mailman, issue the following commands to create the default list (which will prompt you to enter an address for the list administrator and a password), restart Postfix, and start Mailman for the first time:

    newlist mailman
    /etc/init.d/postfix restart
    /etc/init.d/mailman start

If you created lists using the `/etc/aliases` method, you will have to recreate those lists by issuing the following commands.:

    /var/lib/mailman/bin/genaliases
    postmap /var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman

From this point forward, you can create new lists by issuing `newlist` commands as root. Additionally, all administration and functions of the Mailman lists can be accomplished by way of the web based interface.

# Configuring Mailman with Alternate Mail Configurations

If you wish to deploy Mailman on a system that has an existing mail set up, such as the [Postfix with Dovecot and MySQL](/docs/email/postfix/dovecot-mysql-ubuntu-10-04-lucid/) or the [Postfix with Dovecot and System Users](/docs/email/postfix/dovecot-system-users-ubuntu-10-04-lucid) configurations described in other documents, consider the following recommendations:

Complete your basic mail configuration according to the appropriate guide before beginning to install and configure Mailman.

It is absolutely crucial that the `DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST` and `DEFAULT_URL_HOST` are **not** served by your previously configured email system. Any additional domains served by mailman by way of the `add_virtualhost` function must also **not** overlap any domains served by another domain on this host. If these domains overlap there will be collisions, and neither system will function as expected.

In all other respects, as long as you deploy Mailman with virtual hosting on its own domain using Mailman with an existing email solution poses no complications. Congratulations, you now have a fully functional email list management solution!
