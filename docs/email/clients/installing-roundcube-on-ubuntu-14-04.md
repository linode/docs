## Introduction

Roundcube is a web-based IMAP email client that offers an user interface similar to Google’s Gmail or Microsoft’s Hotmail. It is a server-side application written in PHP designed to access **one** email server or service. Email users interact with Roundcube over the internet using a web browser.

## Before You Begin

1. Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and deploy an **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** image to your Linode. Complete the hostname and timezone sections.

2. Complete our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) tutorial to create a standard user account, harden SSH access, and remove unnecessary network services.

{: .note}
>
>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

3. Possess an operational electronic email (email) server. This guide is designed to work with our [Installing Postfix, Dovecot, and MySQL](/docs/email/postfix/email-with-postfix-dovecot-and-mysql) tutorial, but you **can** use a different mail server. Replace `localhost` with the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address of your email server if its hosted elsewhere.

4. Configure an **A HOST** or **CNAME** DNS record ("subdomain") named `webmail` to point at your Linode. Refer to our [Introduction to DNS Records](docs/networking/dns/introduction-to-dns-records) guide if you need help creating this record.

5. Understand that `example.com` is that: an *example* used in this tutorial. This needs to be replace this with **your** domain name. The `webmail` subdomain can also be customized, but make sure to replicate your replacement name throughout the guide.

6. Update your server's software packages:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

## Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) Stack

This section will cover installing Apache, MySQL, PHP, and SSL on your Linode from scratch. If you already have a functioning LAMP stack, skip ahead to the **Creating an Apache Virtual Host with SSL** section.

### Installing LAMP Stack Packages

1. Install the `lamp-server^` *metapackage*, which installs Apache, MySQL, and PHP as dependencies:

        sudo apt-get install lamp-server^

2. Choose a password for the **root** MySQL user. For simplicity, use the same password as your Linode's **root** UNIX user.

3. Secure your new MySQL installation:

        sudo mysql_secure_installation

4. Specify your Linode's time zone in the `/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini` PHP configuration file. If your server is not using `UTC`, replace it with your [local timezone listed on PHP.net](http://nl1.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php):

        sudo sed -i -e "s/^;date\.timezone =.*$/date\.timezone = 'UTC'/" /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

### Creating an Apache Virtual Host with SSL

We will construct a brand new *virtual host* for Roundcube in this section. This creates a new webroot for Roundcube, separating it from any other webroots on your Linode. Replace `webmail.example.com` with the desired domain name or subdomain of your installation.

1. Position your Linode's shell prompt within the `/etc/apache2/sites-available` directory:

        cd /etc/apache2/sites-available

2. Download a copy of our `apache2-roundcube.sample.conf` virtual host configuration file:

        sudo wget https://linode.com/docs/assets/apache2-roundcube.sample.conf

3. Transfer the file's ownership to **root**:

        sudo chown root:root apache2-roundcube.sample.conf

4. Next, change the file's access permissions to `644`:

        sudo chmod 644 apache2-roundcube.sample.conf

5. Open `apache2-roundcube.sample.conf` and update the following options to match your desired configuration:

        sudo nano apache2-roundcube.sample.conf

- **ServerAdmin:** administrative email address for your Linode (e.x. `admin@example.com` or `webmaster@example.com`)
- **ServerName:** full domain name of the virtual host (e.x. `webmail.example.com`)
- **ErrorLog (optional):** path to the custom error log file (e.x. `/var/log/apache2/webmail.example.com/error.log`; uncomment by removing `# `)
- **CustomLog (optional):** path to the custom access log file (e.x. `/var/log/apache2/webmail.example.com/access.log`; again, uncomment by removing `# `)

{: .caution }
>
> Make sure the custom directory and desired `.log` files exist **before** specifying it in your virtual host configuration. Failure to do so will prevent Apache from starting. The files should be owned by the `www-data` user with `644` permissions.

6. Determine what type of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption certificate is best for your Roundcube deployment. A [self-signed SSL certificate](/docs/security/ssl/how-to-make-a-selfsigned-ssl-certificate) is easy and free, but triggers a **your connection is not private** error message in most modern browsers. [Let's Encrypt offers browser trusted, free SSL certificates](/docs/security/ssl/obtaining-lets-encrypt-certificates-on-ubuntu-14-04), but does not support Extended Validated (EV) or multi-domain (wildcard) certificates. To gain those features, use a [commercially purchased SSL certificate](/docs/security/ssl/obtaining-a-commercial-ssl-certificate).

7. Once you have obtained a SSL certificate, update the following options to match it:

- **SSLCertificateFile:** path to the SSL certificate information (`.crt`) file
- **SSLCertificateKeyFile:** path to the SSL certificate private key (`.key`) file

8. Save your file changes and exit the text editor.

{: .note }
>
> Saving the configuration file does not affect Apache... until we explicitly enable it in the **Enabling Roundcube's Apache Virtual Host** section.

9. Rename your configuration file to match its full domain name:

        sudo mv apache2-roundcube.sample.conf webmail.example.com.conf

10. Lastly, disable the default Apache virtual host *unless* you plan to use it.

        sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf default-ssl.conf

### Creating a MySQL Database and User

1. Log into the MySQL command prompt as the **root** user:

        mysql -u root -p

2. Enter the password for your root MySQL user:

        Password: <your invisible password>

{: .note }
>
> Your password will not be shown on screen as you type it. This is a security feature built into most linux programs to protect your password from people standing behind you; it is not a programming glitch.

3. Once logged in and a `mysql>` prompt is shown, create a new MySQL database called `roundcubemail`:

        CREATE DATABASE roundcubemail;

4. Visit [Secure Password Generator](http://passwordsgenerator.net) and generate a 15 character randomized password, making sure to check the **Exclude Ambiguous Characters** checkbox.

5. Create a new MySQL user called `roundcube` and replace `3ENDqKF4jX6fNQh9` with the password you just generated in step four:

        CREATE USER 'roundcube'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '3ENDqKF4jX6fNQh9';

6. Grant the new user `roundcube` full access to Roundcube’s database `roundcubemail`:

        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON roundcubemail.* TO 'roundcube'@'localhost';

7. Flush the MySQL privilege tables to reload them:

        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

8. Log out of the MySQL command prompt and return to a regular Linux shell prompt:

        exit

## Making Final Preparations for Roundcube

1. Install and enable the packages `php-pear`, `php5-intl`, and `php5-mcrypt`:

        sudo apt-get install php-pear php5-intl php5-mcrypt && sudo php5enmod intl mcrypt

2. Enable the Apache modules `deflates`, `expires`, `headers`, `rewrite`, and `ssl`:

        sudo a2enmod deflates expires headers rewrite ssl

3. Additionally, install the PHP PEAR packages `Auth_SASL`, `Net_SMTP`, `Net_IDNA2-0.1.1`, `Mail_mime`, and `Mail_mimeDecode`:

        sudo pear install Auth_SASL Net_SMTP Net_IDNA2-0.1.1 Mail_mime Mail_mimeDecode

{: .note }
>
> PEAR is an acronym for "PHP Extension and Application Repository". Common PHP code libraries, written officially or by third parties, can be easily installed and referenced using the `pear` command.

PEAR will print an **install ok** confirmation message for each package that it successfully installs. In this case, a complete installation will look similar to this:

        install ok: channel://pear.php.net/Auth_SASL-1.0.6
        install ok: channel://pear.php.net/Net_SMTP-1.7.1
        install ok: channel://pear.php.net/Net_IDNA2-0.1.1
        install ok: channel://pear.php.net/Mail_mime-1.10.0
        install ok: channel://pear.php.net/Mail_mimeDecode-1.5.5

## Downloading and Installing Roundcube

1. Make sure your Linode's shell prompt is operating inside your user's home directory. The `~/Downloads` folder is preferable, but `~/` is also acceptable. We won't judge:

        cd ~/Downloads

2. Download Roundcube version 1.1.4:

        wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/roundcubemail/roundcubemail/1.1.4/roundcubemail-1.1.4.tar.gz

If the **Stable > Complete** package listed at [Roundcube’s download page](https://roundcube.net/download/) is newer than `1.1.4`, replace any occurrences of the older version number with the newer one in the command below.

3. Decompress and copy Roundcube to the `/var/www` directory. Again, replace any occurrences of `1.1.4` in the filename with the newer version number:

        sudo tar -zxvf roundcubemail-1.1.4.tar.gz -C /var/www

4. Eliminate the version number from Roundcube's directory name. This will make updating easier later on down the road:

        sudo mv /var/www/roundcubemail-1.1.4 /var/www/roundcube

5. Transfer ownership of the `/var/www/roundcube` directory to the `www-data` user. This will allow Roundcube to save its own configuration file, instead of you having to download it and manually upload it to your Linode:

        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/roundcube

6. Lastly, you should enable Roundcube's automatic cache cleaning shell script:

        echo '0 0 * * * root bash /var/www/roundcube/bin/cleandb.sh >> /dev/null' | sudo tee --append /etc/crontab

This utilizes a *cron job* to run the `cleandb.sh` shell script included with Roundcube once per day at midnight. Read our [Scheduling Tasks with Cron](/docs/tools-reference/tools/schedule-tasks-with-cron) guide to learn about Cron.

## Enabling Roundcube's Apache Virtual Host

1. Enable the `webmail.example.com` virtual host you just wrote in the **Creating an Apache Virtual Host with SSL** section:

        sudo a2ensite webmail.example.com.conf

2. Restart Apache to apply *all* configuration changes and enable your new virtual host:

        sudo service apache2 restart

If `* Restarting web server apache2 ... [ OK ]` appears in your Terminal without any errors, rock on! Your new virtual host is live and you can move on to the next section.

Otherwise, use the error messages to troubleshoot your configuration. Missing files, incorrect permissions, and typos are well-known enemies to Apache.

## Configuring Roundcube

1. Launch your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://webmail.example.com/installer`. Again, make sure to replace `webmail.example.com` with your chosen domain name.

2. Begin configuring Roundcube. The first step of Roundcube’s graphical configuration is an *environment check*. Click on the **NEXT** button at the bottom of the page to continue.

{: .note }
>
> Since Roundcube supports six different SQL engines, five **NOT AVAILABLE** warnings will appear under the **Checking available databases** section. You just installed MySQL, so you can ignore these warnings.

3. Specify your Roundcube configuration options. The list of options below will get you a proper, working configuration, but you can adjust any unmentioned options as you see fit.

- **General configuration > product_name:** Name of your email service (e.g. **Linode Webmail** or **University of Michigan Webmail**)
- **General configuration > support_url:** Where should your users go if they need help? A URL to a web-based contact form or an email address should be used. (e.g. `http://example.com/support` or `mailto:support@example.com`)
- **General configuration > skin_logo:** Replaces the default Roundcube logo with an image of your choice. The image must be located within the `/var/www/roundcube` directory and be linked relatively (e.g. `skins/larry/linode.png`). Recommended image resolution is `177px` by `49px`
- **Database setup > db_dsnw > Database password:** Password for the **roundcube** MySQL user you created (e.g. `3ENDqKF4jX6fNQh9`).
- **IMAP Settings > default_host:** Hostname of your IMAP server. Use `ssl://localhost` to access the local server (i.e. your server) using OpenSSL
- **IMAP Settings > default_port:** TCP port for incoming IMAP connections to your server. Use port `993` to ensure OpenSSL is used
- **IMAP Settings > username_domain:** What domain name should Roundcube assume all users are part of? This allows users to only have to type in their email username (e.g. **somebody**) instead of their full email address (e.g. `somebody@example.com`)
- **SMTP Settings > smtp_server:** Hostname of your SMTP server. Use `ssl://localhost` to access the local server (i.e. your server) using OpenSSL
- **SMTP Settings > smtp_port:** TCP port for incoming SMTP connections to your server. Use port `587` to ensure OpenSSL is used
- **SMTP Settings > smtp_user/smtp_pass:** Click and check the **Use the current IMAP username and password for SMTP authentication** checkbox so that users can send mail without re-typing their user credentials
- **Display settings & user prefs > language:** Allows you to select a default [RFC1766](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1766)-compliant *locale* for Roundcube. A locale is used to set language and user interface options for users based on their language and country. For example, while **G**reat **B**ritain and the **U**nited **S**tates both use **En**glish as their primary language, some of their grammar rules and spellings are different. Thus, Britain's RFC1766 locale is `en_GB` and the United States’ is `en_US`.
- **Display settings & user prefs > draft_autosave:** Due to services like Gmail and Hotmail, most users will expect their drafts to be saved almost instantaneously while they type them. While Roundcube does not offer instantaneous draft saving as an option, it can save a user’s draft every minute. Select `1 min` from the dropdown menu

4. Click on the **CREATE CONFIG** button toward the bottom of the webpage to save your new configuration. You should see a **The config file was saved successfully into RCMAIL_CONFIG_DIR directory of your Roundcube installation** confirmation message on the corresponding page.

5. Complete the configuration by clicking **CONTINUE**.

[![Roundcube configuration saved successfully](/docs/assets/roundcube-configuration-saved-successfully_small.png)](/docs/assets/roundcube-configuration-saved-successfully.png)

6. Lastly, import Roundcube’s MySQL database structure by clicking on the **Initialize database** button.

[![Roundcube MySQL database initialization](/docs/assets/roundcube-mysql-database-initialization.png)]

# Removing the Installer Directory

1. Delete the `/var/www/roundcube/installer` directory, which contains the web page files we just used to configure Roundcube:

        sudo rm -rf /var/www/roundcube/installer

While Roundcube automatically disabled the installer functionality within its configuration file, deleting the installer directory adds another layer of protection against intruders.

## Verifying your Roundcube Installation

1. Navigate to `https://webmail.example.com` and log in using the your email account's username and password.

[![Roundcube login](/docs/assets/roundcube-login.png)]

{: .note }
>
> If your email address is `somebody@example.com`, you only have to enter **somebody** as your username. Roundcube assumes that all users exist at `example.com`.

2. If your configuration is functional, Roundcube will allow you to receive, read, and send emails from inside and outside of your domain name.

## Updating Roundcube (In the Future)

1. Compare the **Stable > Complete** package version listed on [Roundcube's download page](http://roundcube.net/download/) to the version currently installed on your Linode.

2. If a newer version is available, replace any occurrences of `1.1.4` with the newest version in the command below. This will download Roundcube to your `~/Downloads` directory:

        cd ~/Downloads && wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/roundcubemail/roundcubemail/1.1.4/roundcubemail-1.1.4.tar.gz

3. Extract and unzip the *gzipped tarball* (`.tar.gz`) to `~/Downloads`:

        tar -zxvf roundcubemail-1.1.4.tar.gz

4. Begin updating Roundcube by executing the `/var/www/roundcube/bin/installto.sh` PHP script. If you did not install Roundcube in the `/var/www/roundcube` directory, replace the trailing directory with that of Roundcube's on your server:

        cd roundcubemail-1.1.4
        sudo php bin/installto.sh /var/www/roundcube

{: .note }
>
> Roundcube is not installed from a Debian software repository, so you cannot use `sudo apt-get upgrade` to update it.

5. Press the **Y** key followed by **ENTER** or **RETURN** to confirm the update. A successful upgrade will print something similar to this in your Terminal:

        Upgrading from 1.1.4. Do you want to continue? (y/N)
        y
        Copying files to target location...sending incremental file list

        …

        Running update script at target...
        Executing database schema update.
        This instance of Roundcube is up-to-date.
        Have fun!
        All done.

**All done** means the update was successful; unless you don't see this message, proceed to step six.

6. Delete the Roundcube directory and gzipped tarball from `~/Downloads`:

        cd ~/Downloads && rm -rfd roundcubemail-1.1.4 roundcubemail-1.1.4.tar.gz

## Conclusion

Now that you have installed Roundcube, you have your very own free, web-based email client similar to Google’s Gmail or Microsoft’s Hotmail. Users can access their email by navigating to `https://webmail.example.com`.

From here, you can [install plugins to add additional functionality](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Doc_Plugins) and [customize the theme](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Doc_Skins) to match your organization’s color scheme.
