Kubernetes, through efficient container orchestration, has invigorated how people think about managing application clusters. As a result, Kubernetes is a highly talked about and widely used tool, with plenty of community support.

Nomad, however, has started to offer its own take on workload orchestration. Nomad comes with a flexible and simplified approach compared to Kubernetes, but the Nomad system offers more than just a straight alternative.

So what features sets these two apart? Which is better, Kubernetes or Nomad? Better yet, which one should you use?

Learn all about Kubernetes, Nomad, and how they compare in this tutorial.

## What Is Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), originally developed by Google, is now an open-source container orchestration system. Kubernetes manages container deployments, lifecycles, and more, all using a declarative language where you focus on the desired state.

Kubernetes typically operates on a cluster of nodes, where Kubernetes agents control deployments, scheduling, and other tasks.

Kubernetes has become a significant talking point within the cloud computing world. Its influence continues to spread, changing not only how many operations manage deployments, but how people think of deployments entirely. And so Kubernetes' uses and capabilities continue to be extended and developed.

For a more in-depth breakdown of Kubernetes, see our guide [Advantages of Using Kubernetes](/docs/guides/kubernetes-use-cases/).

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Declarative approach to infrastructure

- Portable, cloud-agnostic system

- Open source with significant community support

Cons:

- Complex, often requiring significant resources to maintain

- Limited support for systems other than Linux

## What Is Nomad?

[Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) from HashiCorp offers a workload orchestration system that prioritizes flexibility and simplicity. Nomad's flexibility supports highly-scalable features like multi-region deployments as well as diverse workloads, from containers to standalone applications.

Nomad is part of the HashiCorp ecosystem, making it ready for integration with HashiCorp's other tools, like Consul, Terraform, and Vault.

Nomad's rise has been relatively recent, and discussions have often centered around Nomad as a simplified Kubernetes alternative. But Nomad's flexibility makes it stand out all on its own. Nomad can handle scheduling and management for highly-scalable clusters, and can work with applications that are containerized, non-containerized, or a mix. And it can accomplish all of this across a wider range of systems.

You can learn more about Nomad and how it operates through our tutorial [How to Use Nomad for Container Orchestration](/docs/guides/using-nomad-for-orchestration/).

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Simpler and often requiring less configuration

- Suited to smaller teams, fewer maintenance resources

- Wider range of platforms, operating on macOS and Windows in addition to Linux

Cons:

- Newer, with less community support and less developed tooling

- Closely tied to HashiCorp tools and language

## How Do Nomad and Kubernetes Compare?

With an understanding of what each tool offers on its own, you can take a closer look at how they compare side by side.

### Similarities

Both Nomad and Kubernetes are designed to orchestrate workloads. So you can expect that the two systems have some similarities, features and benefits each one shares with the other.

These are just a few of their similarities, but they highlight key features that make each tool compelling to use for orchestration.

- Declarative approach. Both Nomad and Kubernetes use declarative configuration/automation scripts. The declarative language focuses on the desired state and enables an infrastructure-as-code approach to development.

- Portability. Kubernetes and Nomad operate as cloud-agnostic systems. This makes them adaptable to a wide range of cloud solutions, or on-premise hardware.

- Rolling deployments. Nomad and Kubernetes support rolling upgrades that verify a deployment's health before replacing an old deployment, and each can automatically rollback changes if a deployment fails.

- External storage solutions. Both Kubernetes and Nomad utilize the Container Storage Interface (CSI) standard, allowing them to leverage storage resources on cloud platforms that support CSI. Linode has its own CSI that you could use, for instance, and you can learn more in our guide [How to Deploy Persistent Volume Claims with Linode](/docs/kubernetes/deploy-volumes-with-the-linode-block-storage-csi-driver/).

### Differences

Despite the similarities, Kubernetes and Nomad have different features to recommend them. This is part of what makes Nomad more than just a Kubernetes alternative — in many ways, it is capable of fulfilling a different role.

- Community and tooling. Kubernetes' popularity has given rise to a wide array of community support. Anyone adopting Kubernetes is likely to find a diverse and robust toolset to pull from and solutions from a sizable and experienced community.

    Nomad, on the other hand, is newer and lacks the community that Kubernetes has. But Nomad does have integration with the full HashiCorp suite of tools, giving it ready access to a range of solutions.

- Maintenance. Kubernetes can be a complicated system to set up and maintain, and often a Kubernetes setup requires more hardware and staff. Nomad, on the other hand, is designed for simplicity. This makes it ideal for smaller teams getting started with orchestration and for cases where you want to use fewer resources.

- Flexibility. Nomad supports not just containerized applications, but also standalone applications and frameworks ranging from Docker to Java. Nomad can also operate on a wider range of operating systems, whereas Kubernetes focuses on Linux.

- Supporting platforms. While both Nomad and Kubernetes are cloud-agnostic, Kubernetes has the undeniable advantage of supporting cloud platforms. Google, Amazon, and IBM, for instance, all offer Kubernetes services. Linode has its own [Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/create-lke-cluster) that provides a ready Kubernetes cluster.

## Which Should You Use: Kubernetes or Nomad?

Whether you should use Nomad or Kubernetes depends on your needs and your hardware and maintenance limitations.

Kubernetes often makes the most sense for large projects and large teams. Kubernetes systems tend to require more hardware and more maintenance efforts, although using a platform like the Linode Kubernetes Engine can mitigate those. But Kubernetes offsets such requirements with its robust capabilities when it comes to managing containerized applications across clusters.

Nomad tends to be the better option for smaller projects and smaller teams. Nomad simplifies the orchestration process, with easier maintenance and management. At the same time, Nomad is flexible, allowing it to adapt to particular needs and limitations much more readily than can Kubernetes.

Additionally, Nomad's flexibility makes it a compelling option even for larger projects when scalability is a concern. Nomad has proven more efficient when it comes to large-scale clustering — capable of handling 10,000 clusters compared to Kubernetes' 5,000. Combine that with Nomad's adaptable design, and you can make a Nomad system fit your needs more precisely and effectively.

### Using Them Together

Of course, the least obvious solution is using the two tools together. But this is something that is not only possible but is a compelling way to leverage the features you need from each tool.

Kubernetes offers container orchestration with a rich set of features and can be readily deployed through services like Linode's. Between this and its community support, Kubernetes can be a compelling solution for large, high-profile cloud applications.

But Nomad can be brought in to supplement this. Its flexibility makes it useful for complementary projects that run on a mix of containerized and non-containerized workloads. Its simplicity, on the other hand, makes it quicker, fitting for fast-moving projects with hard deadlines.

## Conclusion

Through this tutorial, you can see what features set Nomad and Kubernetes apart, and which tool is more likely to work best for you. Both offer excellent solutions for container orchestration, and being familiar with each keeps you informed when deciding on a setup.
