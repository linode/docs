[TOBS](https://github.com/timescale/tobs), short for The Observability Stack, is a pre-packaged distribution of monitoring tools and dashboard interfaces. It can be installed on any existing Kubernetes cluster. It includes many of the most popular open-source observability tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, Promlens, TimescaleDB, and others. Together, these provide a maintainable solution to analyze the traffic on the server and identify any potential problems with a deployment. This guide covers deploying TOBS on [LKE](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) (Linode Kubernetes Engine) using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and the [kubectl port-forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#port-forward) command for local access to your monitoring interfaces.

TOBS includes the following components:

* [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) is deployed to collect traces.
* Alertmanager, is deployed alongside Prometheus, forms the alerting layer of the stack, and handles alerts generated by Prometheus.
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) is a data visualization and analytics tool that allows you to build dashboards and graphs for your metrics data.
* [PromLens](https://promlens.com/) helps users build PromQL queries with ease. PromLens is a PromQL query builder that helps you build, understand, and fix your queries much more effectively.
* [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) is for long-term storage of metric data. Long-term storage provides the ability to perform post-hoc analysis on metric data over long periods of time. Such data analysis can be used for capacity planning, identifying slow-moving regressions, trend analysis, auditing, and more. For information about connecting to the database from the cluster, see [TimescaleDB Documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/install/latest/installation-kubernetes/#create-a-database)
* [Promscale](https://docs.timescale.com/promscale/latest/about-promscale/) provides the translation layer between Prometheus and the database. It allows the Prometheus server to store and retrieve metrics from TimescaleDB, and allows users to use PromQL on Promscale and Prometheus.
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) is an open-source systems monitoring and altering stack. It has become the de-facto standard in metric monitoring and is the basis of standards such as OpenMetrics. It allows you to monitor and understand how your infrastructure and applications are performing. Service discovery allows Prometheus to automagically discover components within your Kubernetes cluster that are already emitting metrics.
* [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) exports the metrics related to Kubernetes resources such as the status and count of Kubernetes resources, with visibility of the desired resources and the current resources, as well as the trends in your cluster.
* [Node-Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) is deployed to export node related metrics such as CPU, memory usage, and others from the Kubernetes cluster.

## Before You Begin

{{< note respectIndent=false >}}
This guide was written using [Kubernetes version 1.23](https://v1-17.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/).
{{< /note >}}

1.  [Deploy an LKE Cluster](/docs/guides/deploy-and-manage-a-cluster-with-linode-kubernetes-engine-a-tutorial/). This guide was written using an example node pool with three [2 GB Linodes](https://www.linode.com/pricing/). Depending on the workloads you plan to deploy on your cluster, you may consider using Linodes with more available resources.

1.  Install [Helm 3](/docs/guides/how-to-install-apps-on-kubernetes-with-helm-3/#install-helm) to your local environment.

1.  Install [kubectl](/docs/guides/deploy-and-manage-a-cluster-with-linode-kubernetes-engine-a-tutorial/#install-kubectl) to your local environment and [connect to your cluster](/docs/guides/deploy-and-manage-a-cluster-with-linode-kubernetes-engine-a-tutorial/#connect-to-your-lke-cluster-with-kubectl).

1.  Create the `monitoring` namespace on your LKE cluster:

        kubectl create namespace monitoring

1.  Add the stable Helm charts repository to your Helm repos:

        helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable

1.  Update your Helm repositories:

        helm repo update


## TOBS Minimal Deployment

In this section, learn to deploy TOBS for individual/local access with `kubectl` [Port-Forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#port-forward).

### Deploy The Observability Stack
1. Install a certificate manager for your LKE cluster:

        kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.8.0/cert-manager.yaml

1.  Using Helm, deploy the TOBS release labeled `lke-monitor` in the `monitoring` namespace on your LKE cluster:

        helm repo add timescale https://charts.timescale.com/
        helm repo update
        helm install --wait lke-monitor timescale/tobs --namespace monitoring


1.  Verify that the Prometheus Operator has been deployed to your LKE cluster and its components are running and ready by checking the pods in the `monitoring` namespace:

        kubectl -n monitoring get pods

    You should see a similar output to the following:

    {{< output >}}

### Access Monitoring Interfaces with Port-Forward

1.  List the services running in the `monitoring` namespace and review their respective ports:

        kubectl -n monitoring get svc

    You should see an output similar to the following:

    {{< output >}}
NAME                                                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                           AGE

    {{< /output >}}

    From the above output, the resource services you will access have the corresponding ports:

    | Resource     | Service Name                      | Port |
    | ------------ | ----------------------------------| ---- |
    | Prometheus   | tobs-kube-prometheus-prometheus   | 9090 |
    | Alertmanager | tobs-kube-prometheus-alertmanager | 9093 |
    | Grafana      | lke-monitor-grafana               | 80   |

1.  Use `kubectl` [port-forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#port-forward) to open a connection to a service, then access the service's interface by entering the corresponding address in your web browser:

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
Press **control+C** on your keyboard to terminate a port-forward process after entering any of the following commands.
    {{< /note >}}

    *   To provide access to the **Prometheus** interface at the address `127.0.0.1:9090` in your web browser, enter:

            kubectl -n monitoring \
            port-forward \
            svc/tobs-kube-prometheus-prometheus \
            9090

    *   To provide access to the **Alertmanager** interface at the address `127.0.0.1:9093` in your web browser, enter:

            kubectl -n monitoring \
            port-forward \
            svc/tobs-kube-prometheus-alertmanager  \
            9093

    *   To provide access to the **Grafana** interface at the address `127.0.0.1:8081` in your web browser, enter:

            kubectl -n monitoring \
            port-forward \
            svc/lke-monitor-grafana  \
            8081:80


        When accessing the Grafana interface, log in as `admin`. You can get the `password` using:

            kubectl get secret --namespace monitoring lke-monitor-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo

        The Grafana dashboards are accessible at **Dashboards > Manage** from the left navigation bar.

TOBS eliminates the need to maintain configuration details for each of the applications, while providing standardized monitoring for the applications running on your cluster.
