## Presentation Text

### Get ready!

- We're going to set up a whole Continuous Deployment pipeline
- ... for Kubernetes apps
- ... on a Kubernetes cluster
- Ingredients: cert-manager, GitLab, Helm, Linode DNS, LKE, Traefik

### Philosophy

- "Do one thing, do it well"
- ... But a CD pipeline is a complex system with interconnected parts!
- GitLab is no exception to that rule
- Let's have a look at its components!

### GitLab components

- GitLab dependencies listed in the GitLab official Helm chart
- External dependencies: cert-manager, grafana, minio, nginx-ingress, postgresql, Prometheus, redis, registry, shared-secrets (these dependencies correspond to external charts not created by GitLab)
- Internal dependencies: geo-logcursor, gitaly, gitlab-exporter, gitlab-grafana, gitlab-pages, gitlab-shell, kas, mailroom, migrations, operator, praefect, sidekiq, task-runner, webservice (these dependencies correspond to subcharts embedded in the GitLab chart)

### Philosophy

- Use the GitLab chart to deploy everything that is specific to GitLab
- Deploy cluster-wide components separately (cert-manager, ExternalDNS, Ingress Controller...)

### What we're going to do

- Spin up an LKE cluster
- Run a simple test app
- Install a few extras
        (the cluster-wide components mentioned earlier)
- Set up GitLab
- Push an app with a CD pipeline to GitLab

### What you need to know

- If you just want to follow along and watch...
  - container basics (what's an image, what's a container...)
  - Kubernetes basics (what are Deployments, Namespaces, Pods, Services)
- If you want to run this on your own Kubernetes cluster...
  - intermediate Kubernetes concepts (annotations, Ingresses)
  - Helm basic concepts (how to install/upgrade releases; how to set "values")
  - basic Kubernetes troubleshooting commands (view logs, events)
- There will be a lot of explanations and reminders along the way

### What you need to have

If you want to run this on your own...

- A Linode account
- A domain name that you will point to Linode DNS (I got cloudnative.party for $5)
- Local tools to control your Kubernetes cluster:
  - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
  - [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- Patience, as many operations will require us to wait a few minutes!

### Do I really need a Linode account?

- *Can I use a local cluster, e.g. with Minikube?*

  It will be very difficult to get valid TLS certs with a local cluster.

  Also, GitLab needs quite a bit of resources.

- *Can I use another Kubernetes provider?*

  You certainly can: Kubernetes is a standard platform!

  But you'll have to adjust a few things.

  (I'll try my best to tell you what as we go along.)

### Why do I need a domain name?

- Because accessing gitlab.cloudnative.party is easier than 102.34.55.67

- Because we'll need TLS certificates

  (and it's very easy to obtain certs with Let's Encrypt when we have a domain)

- We'll illustrate automatic DNS configuration with ExternalDNS, too!

  (Kubernetes will automatically create DNS entries in our domain)

### Nice-to-haves

Here are a few tools that I like...

- [linode-cli](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli#installation)
  to manage Linode resources from the command line

- [stern](https://github.com/stern/stern)
  to comfortably view logs of Kubernetes pods

- [k9s](https://k9scli.io/topics/install/)
  to manage Kubernetes resources with that retro BBS look and feel ðŸ˜Ž

- [kube-ps1](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1)
  to keep track of which Kubernetes cluster and namespace we're working on

- [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
  to easily switch between clusters, contexts, and namespaces

### Warning

- We're going to spin up cloud resources

- Remember to shut them down when you're down!
