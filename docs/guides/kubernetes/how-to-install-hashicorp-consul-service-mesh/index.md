[Consul](https://www.consul.io/) is a service mesh offered by HashiCorp, with robust service discovery and diagnostic features for managing your application's services. You can learn more about service meshes in our guide [What Is a Service Mesh?](/docs/guides/what-is-a-service-mesh/). Consul offers a balanced approach between flexibility and usability that makes it a compelling option for managing your service-oriented applications.

In this guide, you can see how to install and get started using the Consul service mesh with a Kubernetes cluster. You can get started with Kubernetes with our [Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) (LKE).

## Before You Begin

- Follow the [Linode Kubernetes Engine - Get Started](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/get-started/) guide to create a Kubernetes cluster using LKE.
- Make sure you install `kubectl` on your local machine and download your cluster's `kubeconfig` file.

## Setting Up Consul

This section shows how to install and start using Consul with your Kubernetes cluster. By the end, you can have Consul deployed to your cluster and learn how to access its dashboard interface for monitoring services.

### Install Helm

Helm is the standard method for installing Consul with Kubernetes. The details in the steps below assume a local machine running Linux on an AMD64 processor. However, they also work for macOS and other processors with slight modifications. For more details on the installation process, refer to Helm's [official installation instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

1. Change into your current user's home directory, and download the `tar.gz` containing the Helm binary.

        cd ~/
        sudo wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.6.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz

1. Extract the archive.

        sudo tar -zxvf helm-v3.6.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz

1. Move the Helm binary to a directory in your system path.

        sudo mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm

### Install Consul

1. Add the HashiCorp repository to Helm.

        helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com

    {{< output >}}
"hashicorp" has been added to your repositories
    {{< /output >}}

1. Verify that you have access to the Helm chart for Consul.

        helm search repo hashicorp/consul

    {{< output >}}
NAME             CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION
hashicorp/consul 0.32.0        1.10.0      Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
    {{< /output >}}

1. Update the repository.

        helm repo update

    {{< output >}}
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "hashicorp" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
    {{< /output >}}

1. Create a configuration file for Consul. The parameters need to be adjusted for your needs. You can refer to our the example configuration file below(example-consul-config.yaml) for a basic working set of options.

    {{< file "example-consul-config.yaml" >}}
global:
  name: consul
  datacenter: dc1
server:
  replicas: 3
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: false
    runAsUser: 0
ui:
  enabled: true
connectInject:
  enabled: true
  default: true
controller:
  enabled: true
    {{< /file >}}

    Take a look at HashiCorp's [Consul and Kubernetes Deployment Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/kubernetes-deployment-guide?in=consul/kubernetes) for another example configuration, and refer to HashiCorp's [Helm Chart Configuration](https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/helm) guide for details on available parameters.

1. Install Consul. The following command assumes your configuration file is named `config.yaml` and is stored in the current working directory.

        helm install consul hashicorp/consul --set global.name=consul -f config.yaml

### Access the Consul Dashboard

1. Configure Kubernetes to forward the port for the Consul dashboard. The following command connects the Consul dashboard interface to your machine's port **18500**.

        kubectl port-forward service/consul-ui 18500:80 --address 0.0.0.0

1. Navigate to `localhost:18500` in your browser to see the Consul dashboard.

## Example Usage

Follow the steps in this section to create a couple of simple services to see the Consul service mesh in action. In this example, you use images provided by HashiCorp for some basic web services and create Kubernetes manifests for each.

### Create the Service Manifests

1. Create a directory for your service manifests. Then, change into that directory. From here on, the guide assumes you are in that directory.

        mkdir example-services
        cd example-services

1. Create a file named `example-service-backend.yaml` for the first of your services. Add the contents of the example file below.

    {{< file "example-service-backend.yaml" >}}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: back-end-service

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: back-end-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: back-end-service
  ports:
    - port: 9091
      targetPort: 9091
---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: back-end-service
  labels:
    app: back-end-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: back-end-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: back-end-service
      annotations:
        consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject: 'true'
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: back-end-service
          image: nicholasjackson/fake-service:v0.7.8
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9091
          env:
            - name: 'NAME'
              value: 'back-end-service'
            - name: 'LISTEN_ADDR'
              value: '127.0.0.1:9091'
            - name: 'MESSAGE'
              value: 'This is a response from the back-end service.'
    {{< /file >}}

    The above example file creates a service and defines its deployment parameters. Take note of the `annotations` section. The `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject: 'true'` annotation tells Consul to inject a proxy with the service. This annotation should be included in the deployment manifest for any service you want to deploy to Kubernetes and have take part in your Consul service mesh.

1. Create another file named `example-service-frontend.yaml` for the second of your services. Add the contents of the example file below.

    {{< file "example-service-frontend.yaml" >}}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: front-end-service

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: front-end-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: front-end-service
  ports:
    - port: 9090
      targetPort: 9090
---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: front-end-service
  labels:
    app: front-end-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: front-end-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: front-end-service
      annotations:
        consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject: 'true'
        consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams: 'back-end-service:9091'
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: front-end-service
          image: nicholasjackson/fake-service:v0.7.8
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9090
          env:
            - name: 'NAME'
              value: 'front-end-service'
            - name: 'LISTEN_ADDR'
              value: '0.0.0.0:9090'
            - name: 'UPSTREAM_URIS'
              value: 'http://localhost:9091'
            - name: 'MESSAGE'
              value: 'This is a message from the front-end service.'
    {{< /file >}}

    This file's contents are similar to the previous file. However, it adds an additional annotation. The new annotation here — `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams: 'back-end-service:9091'` — tells Consul that this service has the service defined in the previous file as an upstream dependency.

### Deploy the Services

1. Deploy the services to your Kubernetes cluster.

        kubectl apply -f example-service-backend.yaml
        kubectl apply -f example-service-frontend.yaml

1. View the pods using kubectl. Wait until the services' pods go into `Running` status before proceeding to the next step.

        kubectl get pods

1. Confirm that Consul has injected proxies alongside the services.

        kubectl get pods --selector consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject-status=injected

    {{< output >}}
NAME                                      READY   STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
back-end-service-75cbb6cbb6-wlvf4         2/2     Running        0          3m5s
front-end-service-7dcdcc5676-zqhxh        2/2     Running        0          3m35s
    {{< /output >}}

### Review the Services

1. You can see the services in action by forwarding the port for the front-end service.

        kubectl port-forward service/front-end-service 9090:9090 --address 0.0.0.0

    Navigate to `localhost:9090/ui` in your browser to see the services' output.

1. Review the services in Consul's dashboard.

        kubectl port-forward service/consul-ui 18500:80 --address 0.0.0.0

    Again, navigate to `localhost:18500` in your browser to see the Consul dashboard, where the new services should be listed.
