1. On your [cluster's details page](/docs/kubernetes/deploy-and-manage-a-cluster-with-linode-kubernetes-engine-a-tutorial/#access-your-cluster-s-details-page), click the **Resize Pool** option at the top-right of each entry in the **Node Pools** section.

    Using the sidebar that appears to the right of the page, you can now remove `-` or add `+` Linodes to the pool, and the total cost of your new resources will be displayed. To accept these changes, select the `Save Changes` button to continue.

    {{< caution >}}
Shrinking a node pool will result in deletion of Linodes. Any local storage on deleted Linodes (such as "hostPath" and "emptyDir" volumes, or "local" PersistentVolumes) will be erased.

1. To remove a node pool from the [cluster's details page](#access-your-cluster-s-details-page), click the **Delete Pool** option at the top-right of each entry in the **Node Pools** section. A pop-up message will then appear confirming that you're sure you'd like to proceed with deletion. Select the `Delete` option, and your Node Pool will proceed to be deleted.

Your cluster must always have at least one active node pool.
