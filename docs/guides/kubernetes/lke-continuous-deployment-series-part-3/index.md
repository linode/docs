## Presentation Text

### Deploying our LKE cluster

- *If we wanted to deploy Kubernetes manually*, what would we need to do?

  (not that I recommend doing that...)

- Control plane (etcd, API server, scheduler, controllers)

- Nodes (VMs with a container engine + the kubelet agent; CNI setup)

- High availability (etcd clustering, API load balancer)

- Security (CA and TLS certificates everywhere)

- Cloud integration (to provision LoadBalancer services, storage...)

*And that's just to get a basic cluster!*

### The best way to deploy Kubernetes

*The best way to deploy Kubernetes is to get someone else to
do it for us.*

(Me, ever since I've been working with Kubernetes)

### Managed Kubernetes

- Cloud provider runs the control plane

  (including etcd, API load balancer, TLS setup, cloud integration)

- We run nodes

  (the cloud provider generally gives us an easy way to provision them)

- Get started in *minutes*

- We're going to use [Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/)

### Creating a cluster

- With the web console:

  https://cloud.linode.com/kubernetes/clusters

- Pick the region of your choice

- Pick the latest available Kubernetes version

- Pick 3 nodes with 8 GB of RAM

- Click! ✨

- Wait a few minutes... ⌚️

- Download the kubeconfig file 💾

### With the CLI

- View available regions with `linode-cli regions list`

- View available server types with `linode-cli linodes types`

- View available Kubernetes versions with `linode-cli lke versions-list`

- Create cluster:

      linode-cli lke cluster-create --label=hello-lke --region=us-east \
        --k8s_version=1.20 --node_pools.type=g6-standard-4 --node_pools.count=3

- Note the cluster ID (e.g.: 12345)

- Download the kubeconfig file:

      linode-cli lke kubeconfig-view `12345` --text --no-headers | base64 -d

### Communicating with the cluster

- All the Kubernetes tools (`kubectl`, but also `helm` etc) use the same config file

- That file is (by default) `$HOME/.kube/config`

- It can hold multiple cluster definitions (or *contexts*)

- Or, we can have multiple config files and switch between them:

  - by adding the `--kubeconfig` flag each time we invoke a tool (🙄)

  - or by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable (☺️)

### Using the kubeconfig file

Option 1:

- move the kubeconfig file to e.g. `~/.kube/config.lke`

- set the environment variable: `export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config.lke`

Option 2:

- directly move the kubeconfig file to `~/.kube/config`

- **do not** do that if you already have a file there!

Option 3:

- merge the new kubeconfig file with our existing file

### Merging kubeconfig

- Assuming that we want to merge `~/.kube/config` and `~/.kube/config.lke` ...

- Move our existing kubeconfig file:

      cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.old

- Merge both files:

      KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config.old:~/.kube/config.lke kubectl config \
          view --raw > ~/.kube/config


- Check that everything is there:

      kubectl config get-contexts

### Are we there yet?

- Let's check if our control plane is available:

      kubectl get services

  → This should show the `kubernetes` `ClusterIP` service

- Look for our nodes:

      kubectl get nodes

  → This should show 3 nodes (or whatever amount we picked earlier)

- If the nodes aren't visible yet, give them a minute to join the cluster
