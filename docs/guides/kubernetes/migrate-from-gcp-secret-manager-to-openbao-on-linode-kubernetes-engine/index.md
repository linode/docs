Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Secret Manager is a managed service that securely stores sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and certificates. It integrates with other GCP services and simplifies access control through Identity and Access Management (IAM).

[OpenBao](https://openbao.org/) is an open source fork of [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) that gives teams full control over how secrets are stored, encrypted, and accessed. Unlike managed platforms, OpenBao can be self-hosted in any environment, including on-premises and across multiple clouds.

This guide walks through how to migrate secrets from GCP Secret Manager to OpenBao running on Akamai Cloud.

## Before You Begin

1.  Follow our [Getting Started](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/getting-started) guide to create an Akamai Cloud account if you do not already have one.

1.  Create a personal access token using the instructions in our [Manage personal access tokens](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/manage-personal-access-tokens) guide.

1.  Install the Linode CLI using the instructions in the [Install and configure the CLI](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/install-and-configure-the-cli) guide.

1.  Follow the steps in the *Install `kubectl`* section of the [Getting started with LKE](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/getting-started-with-lke-linode-kubernetes-engine#install-kubectl) guide to install and configure `kubectl`.

1.  Ensure that you have access to your GCP account with sufficient permissions to work with GCP Secret Manager. The [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) must also be installed and configured.

1.  Install `jq`, a lightweight command line JSON processor.

## Review Existing Secrets in GCP Secret Manager

Before migrating to OpenBao, evaluate how your organization currently uses GCP Secret Manager.

For example, a web application might verify the signature of a JSON Web Token (JWT) using a secret key stored in GCP Secret Manager. Instead of hardcoding the secret in source code or container images, the application is granted a role that allows it to retrieve the secret at runtime. This protects the secret from being exposed through version control or CI/CD pipelines.

OpenBao supports similar access workflows using dynamic injection, AppRole-based access control, and tight integration with Kubernetes workloads.

{{< note type="warning" >}}
Ensure that you securely handle any exported secrets, as they no longer benefit from encryption by GCP Secret Manager.

### Review Secrets Using the GCP Console

1.  Navigate to **Security > Secret Manager** to list secrets:

    ![GCP Secret Manager UI showing list of stored secrets.](gcp-secret-manager-secret-list.png)

1.  Select a secret, open the latest version, and click **Actions > View secret value**:

    ![GCP Secret Manager UI displaying how to value of a selected secret.](gcp-secret-manager-secret-value.png)

### Review Secrets Using the `gcloud` CLI

You can also use the `gcloud` CLI to authenticate and inspect the secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager.

1.  Authenticate with the CLI:

    ```command
    gcloud auth login
    ```

1.  Set the active project, replacing {{< placeholder "PROJECT_ID" >}} (e.g. `ecommerce-application-454116`) with your actual project ID:

    ```command
    gcloud config set project {{< placeholder "PROJECT_ID" >}}
    ```

1.  [List](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/secrets/list) all secrets:

    ```command
    gcloud secrets list
    ```

    ```output
    NAME                       CREATED              REPLICATION_POLICY  LOCATIONS
    billing_service_API_key    2025-03-01T12:25:36  automatic           -
    deploy_key                 2025-02-28T04:04:58  automatic           -
    inventory_service_API_key  2024-11-15T16:35:35  automatic           -
    jwt-signing-secret         2025-03-08T12:01:30  automatic           -
    slack_webhook_url          2024-11-19T21:19:15  automatic           -
    ```

1.  Retrieve the [latest version](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/secrets/versions/access) of a secret, replacing {{< placeholder "SECRET_NAME" >}} (e.g. `jwt-signing-secret`) with an actual secret name:

    ```command
    gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret={{< placeholder "SECRET_NAME" >}}
    ```

    ```output
    EU&&7O^#c2GAMIdRyJlZkPEdoWKgy%CW
    ```

## Deploy OpenBao on Akamai Cloud

When migrating from GCP Secret Manager to OpenBao on Akamai Cloud, your deployment requirements determine whether to install OpenBao on a single Linode Instance or to deploy it in a fault-tolerant environment using the Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE). Follow the appropriate guide below:

-   [Deploying OpenBao on a Linode Instance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x30v1xT_EDuRNnhE9jv5VkFqj9Lo4N3kNO6ICOoSrOM/edit?usp=sharing)
-   [Deploying OpenBao on Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gS6hQg09Ufr1Ku0v528acLESnyj1ZpXTxLhkLIlP-u8/edit?usp=sharing)
-   [Deploying OpenBao through the Linode Marketplace](/docs/marketplace-docs/guides/openbao/)

Regardless of the method used, make sure that:

-   OpenBao is successfully initialized.
-   The vault is unsealed.
-   The `BAO_ADDR` environment variable is set.
-   You are authenticated using the root token.

Once these steps are complete, return to this guide to begin migrating secrets.

### Create a Policy and AppRole

To replicate GCP IAM-style access control, OpenBao provides AppRoles. For example, in GCP, a service might be granted a role like `JWTSigner` to retrieve a secret. In OpenBao, this same functionality is implemented using a policy-bound AppRole.

Follow these steps to create an OpenBao AppRole that mimics the role-based access used in GCP IAM.

#### Enable AppRole

1.  Enable the AppRole authentication method:

    ```command
    bao auth enable approle
    ```

    ```output
    Success! Enabled approle auth method at: approle/
    ```

#### Create a Policy

2.  Create a new `.hcl` policy file in `/etc/openbao`, replacing {{< placeholder "POLICY_FILENAME" >}} (e.g. `jwt-secrets-policy.hcl`) with a policy filename of your choosing:

    ```command
    sudo nano /etc/openbao/{{< placeholder "POLICY_FILENAME" >}}
    ```

    Give the file the following contents, replacing {{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}} (e.g. `jwt`) with your chosen mount path:

    ```file {title="jwt-secrets-policy.hcl"}
    path "{{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}}/*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
    ```

    This policy grants read access to any secrets within the specified mount path (e.g. `jwt`).

    When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

3.  Add the policy to OpenBao, replacing {{< placeholder "POLICY_NAME" >}} (e.g. `jwt-secrets-policy`) and {{< placeholder "POLICY_FILENAME" >}} (e.g. `jwt-secrets-policy.hcl`):

    ```command
    bao policy write {{< placeholder "POLICY_NAME" >}} /etc/openbao/{{< placeholder "POLICY_FILENAME" >}}
    ```

    ```output
    Success! Uploaded policy: jwt-secrets-policy
    ```

#### Create an AppRole

4.  Create an AppRole for the application that needs access to the secret, replacing {{< placeholder "APPROLE_NAME" >}} (e.g. `app-authenticator-approle`) and {{< placeholder "POLICY_NAME" >}} (e.g. `jwt-secrets-policy`):

    ```command
    bao write \
      auth/approle/role/{{< placeholder "APPROLE_NAME" >}} \
      token_policies={{< placeholder "POLICY_NAME" >}}
    ```

    ```output
    Success! Data written to: auth/approle/role/app-authenticator-approle
    ```

5.  Verify that the AppRole was written successfully, replacing {{< placeholder "APPROLE_NAME" >}} (e.g. `app-authenticator-approle`):

    ```command
    bao read auth/approle/role/{{< placeholder "APPROLE_NAME" >}}
    ```

    ```output
    Key                        Value
    ---                        -----
    bind_secret_id             true
    local_secret_ids           false
    secret_id_bound_cidrs      <nil>
    secret_id_num_uses         0
    secret_id_ttl              0s
    token_bound_cidrs          []
    token_explicit_max_ttl     0s
    token_max_ttl              0s
    token_no_default_policy    false
    token_num_uses             0
    token_period               0s
    token_policies             [jwt-secrets-policy]
    token_strictly_bind_ip     false
    token_ttl                  0s
    token_type                 default
    ```

6.  Fetch the AppRole ID, replacing {{< placeholder "APPROLE_NAME" >}} (e.g. `app-authenticator-approle`):

    ```command
    bao read auth/approle/role/{{< placeholder "APPROLE_NAME" >}}/role-id
    ```

    ```output
    Key        Value
    ---        -----
    role_id    019e2cc5-b8ce-4aa4-91b9-c2c9e9e59863
    ```

#### Generate a Secret ID

7.  Generate a secret ID for the role, replacing {{< placeholder "APPROLE_NAME" >}} (e.g. `app-authenticator-approle`)::

    ```command
    bao write -f auth/approle/role/{{< placeholder "APPROLE_NAME" >}}/secret-id
    ```

    ```output
    Key                   Value
    ---                   -----
    secret_id             cef786fb-1d1c-4c52-9466-aea47b3c8d3a
    secret_id_accessor    373500ba-6922-4f91-b7f3-ec25f8253d1d
    secret_id_num_uses    0
    secret_id_ttl         0s
    ```

#### Generate an API Token

8.  Generate an API token for the AppRole, supplying the {{< placeholder "APPROLE_ID" >}} (e.g. `019e2cc5-b8ce-4aa4-91b9-c2c9e9e59863`) and {{< placeholder "APPROLE_SECRET_ID" >}} (e.g. `cef786fb-1d1c-4c52-9466-aea47b3c8d3a`) from the previous commands:

    ```command
    bao write auth/approle/login \
      role_id="{{< placeholder "APPROLE_ID" >}}" \
      secret_id="{{< placeholder "APPROLE_SECRET_ID" >}}"
    ```

    ```output
    Key                     Value
    ---                     -----
    token                   s.dy572yUtTNvHTZgIoxdNVO41
    token_accessor          zT1TP281vORYSjysBiuMydht
    token_duration          768h
    token_renewable         true
    token_policies          ["jwt-secrets-policy" "default"]
    identity_policies       []
    policies                ["jwt-secrets-policy" "default"]
    token_meta_role_name    app-authenticator-approle
    ```

    The AppRole token (e.g. `s.dy572yUtTNvHTZgIoxdNVO41`) can be used by a user, machine, or service, such as the authentication API for a web application, to authenticate OpenBao API calls, giving the caller authorization to read the JWT signing secret.

### Storing Secrets

Create the secret store defined in the policy created above.

1.  Enable the KV secrets engine, replacing {{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}} (e.g. `jwt`):

    ```command
    bao secrets enable --path={{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}} kv
    ```

    ```output
    Success! Enabled the kv secrets engine at: jwt/
    ```

1.  Store your {{< placeholder "SECRET_VALUE" >}} (e.g. `EU&&7O^#c2GAMIdRyJlZkPEdoWKgy%CW`) in the {{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}} (e.g. `jwt`) as a secret named {{< placeholder "SECRET_NAME" >}} (e.g. `signer`):

    ```command
    bao kv put --mount={{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}} {{< placeholder "SECRET_NAME" >}} \
      "secret"="{{< placeholder "SECRET_VALUE" >}}"
    ```

    ```output
    Success! Data written to: jwt/signer
    ```

### Retrieving Secrets

1.  While authenticated with the root token, retrieve the secret using the OpenBao CLI, replacing {{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}} (e.g. `jwt`) and {{< placeholder "SECRET_NAME" >}} (e.g. `signer`):

    ```command
    bao kv get --mount={{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}} {{< placeholder "SECRET_NAME" >}}
    ```

    ```output
    ====== Data ======
    Key         Value
    ---         -----
    secret      EU&&7O^#c2GAMIdRyJlZkPEdoWKgy%CW
    ```

1.  Test access using the {{< placeholder "APPROLE_TOKEN" >}} (e.g. `s.dy572yUtTNvHTZgIoxdNVO41`) saved earlier, {{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}} (e.g. `jwt`), and {{< placeholder "SECRET_NAME" >}} (e.g. `signer`):

    ```command
    curl --header "X-Vault-Token: {{< placeholder "APPROLE_TOKEN" >}}" \
         --request GET \
         $BAO_ADDR/v1/{{< placeholder "SECRET_MOUNT_PATH" >}}/{{< placeholder "SECRET_NAME" >}} \
         | jq
    ```

    ```output
    {
      "request_id": "0e70b929-06b6-4685-b787-dc1ce6c31b9b",
      "lease_id": "",
      "renewable": false,
      "lease_duration": 2764800,
      "data": {
        "secret": "EU&&7O^#c2GAMIdRyJlZkPEdoWKgy%CW"
      },
      "wrap_info": null,
      "warnings": null,
      "auth": null
    }
    ```

    The AppRole token can be used by applications or services to retrieve secrets through the OpenBao API.

    {{< note >}}
    According to the [OpenBao API documentation](https://openbao.org/api-docs/libraries/), OpenBao is API-compatible with HashiCorp Vault. This means most Vault client libraries should also work with OpenBao, including:

    -   [Go](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/tree/main/api)
    -   [Ruby](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-ruby)
    -   [C#](https://github.com/rajanadar/VaultSharp)
    -   [Java](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/libraries#java)
    -   [Kotlin](https://github.com/kunickiaj/vault-kotlin)
    -   [Node.js](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/libraries#node-js)
    -   [PHP](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/libraries#php)
    -   [Python](https://github.com/hvac/hvac)

## Production Considerations

When migrating from GCP Secret Manager to OpenBao on Akamai Cloud, it's important to ensure your deployment is secure, resilient, and optimized for performance. This section covers key security and high availability considerations to help you maintain a reliable and protected secrets management system.

### Security

For a production-grade OpenBao deployment, security should be a top priority. Protecting secrets from unauthorized access, ensuring secure communication, and enforcing strict access controls are essential to maintaining a secure environment.

-   **Access Control Policies**: Use OpenBao's [policy](https://openbao.org/docs/concepts/policies/) system to enforce RBAC. Define granular policies that only grant the necessary permissions, following the principle of least privilege.
-   **Audit Logging**: Enable [detailed audit logs](https://openbao.org/docs/configuration/log-requests-level/) to track all access and modifications to secrets. OpenBao supports multiple logging backends, such as syslog and file-based logs, to help monitor suspicious activity.
-   **Secrets Lifecycle Management**: Implement automated secrets rotation, revocation, and expiration to ensure secrets do not become stale or overexposed. Consider using dynamic secrets where possible to generate time-limited credentials.
-   **Securing Network Communication**: Configure OpenBao to [use TLS to encrypt](https://openbao.org/docs/configuration/listener/tcp/#configuring-tls) all communications, ensuring data in transit remains secure. Regularly rotate TLS certificates to prevent expiration-related outages and reduce the risk of compromised certificates.

### High Availability

For production environments, OpenBao should be deployed with fault tolerance and scalability in mind. OpenBaoâ€™s [Autopilot mode](https://openbao.org/docs/concepts/integrated-storage/autopilot) for [high availability](https://openbao.org/docs/internals/high-availability/) ensures that if the active node fails, the cluster automatically elects a new leader, maintaining uptime without manual intervention. However, to enable seamless failover, organizations must configure their deployment correctly, and proactively monitor system health.

-   **Raft Storage Backend**: Use OpenBaoâ€™s [integrated storage](https://openbao.org/docs/internals/integrated-storage/), based on the [Raft protocol](https://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/), to enable distributed data replication across multiple nodes. This ensures data consistency and fault tolerance while reducing reliance on external storage backends. Configure regular Raft snapshots for disaster recovery.
-   **Deploy Multiple Nodes**: OpenBao recommends at least five nodes for a [high-availability deployment](https://openbao.org/docs/concepts/ha/). The active node handles all requests, while standby nodes remain ready to take over in case of failure.
-   **Monitor Leader Status**: Use [bao operator raft list-peers](https://openbao.org/docs/commands/operator/raft/#list-peers) to check the clusterâ€™s leader and node statuses. This command helps ensure that standby nodes are correctly registered and ready for failover.
