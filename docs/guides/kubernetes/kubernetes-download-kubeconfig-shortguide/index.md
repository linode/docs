Anytime after your cluster is created you can download its *kubeconfig*. The kubeconfig is a YAML file that will allow you to use kubectl to communicate with your cluster. Here is an example kubeconfig file:

{{< file "example-cluster-kubeconfig.yaml" yaml >}}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
preferences: {}

clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1CRUd...
    server: https://example.us-central.linodelke.net:443
  name: lke1234

users:
- name: lke1234-admin
  user:
    as-user-extra: {}
    token: LS0tLS1CRUd...

contexts:
- context:
    cluster: lke1234
    namespace: default
    user: lke1234-admin
  name: lke1234-ctx

current-context: lke1234-ctx
{{< /file >}}

This configuration file defines your cluster, users, and contexts.

1. To access your cluster's kubeconfig, log into your Cloud Manager account and navigate to the **Kubernetes** section.

1. From the Kubernetes listing page, click on your cluster's **more options ellipsis** and select **Download kubeconfig**. The file will be saved to your computer's `Downloads` folder.

    {{< disclosure-note "Download and view your Kubeconfig from the cluster's details page">}}
You can also download the kubeconfig from the Kubernetes cluster's details page.

1. When viewing the Kubernetes listing page, click on the cluster for which you'd like to download a kubeconfig file.

1. On the cluster's details page, under the **kubeconfig** section, click the **Download icon**. The file will be saved to your `Downloads` folder.

1. To view the contents of your kubeconfig file, click on the **View icon**. A pane will appear with the contents of your cluster's kubeconfig file.

{{</ disclosure-note >}}

1. To improve security, change the `kubeconfig.yaml` file permissions to be only accessible by the current user:

        chmod go-r /Downloads/kubeconfig.yaml

1. Open a terminal shell and save your kubeconfig file's path to the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable. In the example command, the kubeconfig file is located in the `Downloads` folder, but you should alter this line with this folder's location on your computer:

        export KUBECONFIG=~/Downloads/kubeconfig.yaml

    {{< note >}}
It is common practice to store your kubeconfig files in `~/.kube` directory. By default, kubectl will search for a kubeconfig file named `config` that is located in the  `~/.kube` directory. You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable, as done in the step above.
{{</ note >}}

1. View your cluster's nodes using kubectl.

        kubectl get nodes

    {{< note >}}
If your kubectl commands are not returning the resources and information you expect, then your client may be assigned to the wrong cluster context. Visit our [Troubleshooting Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes/troubleshooting-kubernetes/#troubleshooting-examples) guide to learn how to switch cluster contexts.

      You are now ready to manage your cluster using kubectl. For more information about using kubectl, see Kubernetes' [Overview of kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) guide.
