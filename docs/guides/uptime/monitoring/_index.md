description: "Whether you need to watch basic usage stats or need more advanced functionality, these guides will help you deploy open source server monitoring solutions on your Linux cloud server. The [Linode Longview](/docs/products/tools/longview/get-started/) tool also offers system metrics and graphing, which can be used in conjunction with any of these monitoring tools, or with the [Linode Manager email alerts](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/monitor-and-maintain/#configuring-linode-manager-email-alerts) to keep an eye on your system."
