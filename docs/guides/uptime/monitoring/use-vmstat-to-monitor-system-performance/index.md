## What is vmstat?

[Vmstat](https://linux.die.net/man/8/vmstat) is a built-in Linux system monitoring tool. Its primary job is measuring a system's usage of virtual memory. No matter how powerful it is, a Linux server has a finite amount of random access memory (RAM). A Linux system can run out of RAM for several reasons, such as demands on the operating system and its running applications. When this happens, the Linux kernel *swaps* or *pages* out programs to the computer's storage devices, called *swap space*. Typically, this is a reserved area of hard drive or solid-state drive storage. It's used as virtual memory when RAM is unavoidable. As RAM is freed up, the swapped-out data or code is swapped back into the main RAM-based memory.

System performance drops drastically when swapping happens. That's because the server's swap I/O speed is much slower than RAM even if the hardware – such as fast SSD – is used for virtual memory. In addition, when Linux uses virtual memory it spends more of its CPU cycles on managing virtual memory swapping.

That means that Linux system administrators have to pay attention to a server's memory usage. Nobody wants a system to slow down. When it does, and admins need to troubleshoot, virtual memory is a likely culprit. Since virtual memory has a big impact on system performance, vmstat is essential for monitoring it. In addition to monitoring virtual memory paging, vmstat also measures processes, I/O, CPU, and disk scheduling.

## How to Use vmstat

You can run `vmstat` both as an interactive program and in shell programs. When you run vmstat without any parameters, it shows system values based on the averages for each element since the server was last rebooted. These results are not a snapshot of current values.

Run vmstat using the following command:

        vmstat

You see a similar output:

{{< output >}}
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 0  0      0 1171312  69752 2231152    0    0     0    13   10   23  0  0 100  0  0
{{</ output >}}

Notice how vmstat returns information about the system's processes, memory, swap, input and output, system interrupts and context switches, and CPU. To learn more about each column and value, view the manual pages for vmstat by issuing the `man vmstat` command and searching for each specific area. For example, once you are viewing the vmstat manual pages, to view more information about the `swap` column, issue the `/swap` command.

The vmstat command-line options provide more information about your system. The vmstat syntax is as follows:

        vmstat [options] [delay] [count]]

- **Options**: vmstat command settings
- **Delay**: the time interval between updates. If no delay is specified, the report runs as an average since the last reboot.
- **Count**: the number of updates printed after the given delay interval. If no count is set, the default is an infinite number of updates every `x` seconds (where x = delay).

For example, you can issue the following command to run vmstat every five second, five times on an idle system:

        vmstat 5 5

Your output should resemble the following:

{{< output >}}
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st

### vmstat Commands

`vmstat` is often run with an interval of 1 second for a small number of seconds depending on kind of problem the administrator is trying to diagnose. The following example illustrates an interval of one (1) second twenty (20) times:

    vmstat 1 20

Your output resembles the following:

{{< output >}}

You may run `vmstat` without a `[count]` argument if you want ongoing reports of the system's status in real time. In these cases, intervals of 30 seconds or more may be desirable.

    vmstat 30

Your output resembles the following:

You may choose to direct this output to a file for logging instead of leaving it running endlessly in a background terminal session. To stop the `vmstat` process, send the break character (**^C** or **Control+C**) as above.

In the default operation, `vmstat` displays memory statistics in kilobytes. `vmstat` considers a single kilobyte equal to 1024 bytes. To generate `vmstat` reports where 1 kilobyte is equal to 1000 bytes, use the following form:

    vmstat -S k 1 10

Your output resembles the following:

`vmstat` can also display reports with memory sizes reported in megabytes. `vmstat` reports with the argument `-S m` will consider a single megabyte equal to 1000 kilobytes as follows:

    vmstat -S m 1 10

Your output resembles the following:

`vmstat` is also able to display megabytes such that a single megabyte is equal to 1024 kilobytes with the argument `-S M`. Consider the following example:

## How to Interpret vmstat Output

`vmstat` reports describe the current state of a Linux system. Information regarding the running state of a system is useful when diagnosing performance related issues. Often [Linode Support](/docs/platform/support) will request `vmstat` reports in order to more conclusively diagnose some issues; however, with a little background in what all of the data represents, you can interpret this data yourself.

The output of `vmstat` is displayed in a number of columns. The following sections provide brief overviews of the data reported in each column.

### Procs

The `procs` data reports the number of processing jobs waiting to run and allows you to determine if there are processes "blocking" your system from running smoothly.

The `r` column displays the total number of processes waiting for access to the processor. The `b` column displays the total number of processes in a "sleep" state.

These values are often `0`.

### Memory

The information displayed in the `memory` section provides the same data about [memory usage](/docs/tools-reference/linux-system-administration-basics/#check-current-memory-usage) as the command `free -m`.

The `swapd` or "swapped" column reports how much memory has been swapped out to a swap file or disk. The `free` column reports the amount of unallocated memory. The `buff` or "buffers" column reports the amount of allocated memory in use. The `cache` column reports the amount of allocated memory that could be swapped to disk or unallocated if the resources are needed for another task.

### Swap

The `swap` section reports the rate that memory is sent to or retrieved from the swap system. By reporting "swapping" separately from total disk activity, `vmstat` allows you to determine how much disk activity is related to the swap system.

The `si` column reports the amount of memory that is moved from swap to "real" memory per second. The `so` column reports the amount of memory that is moved to swap from "real" memory per second.

### I/O

The `io` section reports the amount of input and output activity per second in terms of blocks read and blocks written.

The `bi` column reports the number of blocks received, or "blocks in", from a disk per second. The `bo` column reports the number of blocks sent, or "blocks out", to a disk per second.

### System

The `system` section reports data that reflects the number of system operations per second.

The `in` column reports the number of system interrupts per second, including interrupts from system clock. The `cs` column reports the number of context switches that the system makes in order to process all tasks.

### CPU

The `cpu` section reports on the use of the system's CPU resources. The columns in this section always add to 100 and reflect "percentage of available time".

The `us` column reports the amount of time that the processor spends on userland tasks, or all non-kernel processes. The `sy` column reports the amount of time that the processor spends on kernel related tasks. The `id` column reports the amount of time that the processor spends idle. The `wa` column reports the amount of time that the processor spends waiting for IO operations to complete before being able to continue processing tasks.
