## Introduction to Installing Git

![How to Install Git on Linux, Mac or Windows](how-to-install-git.jpg)

Git was designed and developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) for Linux kernel development. Git provides support for non-linear, distributed development, allowing multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously. Git is the most popular distributed version control and source code management system.

This guide explains how to install the latest, stable, and prepackaged version of Git on GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows, using their respective package managers. Git can also be [compiled from source and installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_from_source) on any operating system.

For more information about using and configuring Git, see our [Getting Started with Git](/docs/development/version-control/how-to-configure-git/) guide.

### How do I know if Git is installed?

To see if Git is installed on your system, open your terminal and type `git --version`. If your terminal returns a Git version as an output, that confirms you have Git installed on your system. If not, you have to download Git for Mac or Windows.

### Are Git and GitHub the same?

Git and GitHub are different. GitHub hosts Git repositories in a central location, whereas Git is a tool that manages multiple versions of source code on GitHub.

### How do I download Git for Windows?

To download Git for Windows, visit the [Downloads page](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on the Git documentation site and select the most recent version. Once you click on the version your download starts shortly and you can install Git for Windows.

Go to the repository’s page on GitHub, click on the green **Code** button, and copy the URL of the repository. To clone the repository on your system, open your Terminal and run `git clone URL`. Replace `URL` with the repository's URL.
