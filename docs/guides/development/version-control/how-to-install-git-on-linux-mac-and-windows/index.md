## Introduction to Installing Git

![How to Install Git on Linux, Mac or Windows](how-to-install-git.jpg)

Git was designed and developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) for Linux kernel development. Git provides support for non-linear, distributed development, allowing multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously. Git is the most popular distributed version control and source code management system.

This guide explains how to install the latest, stable, and prepackaged version of Git on GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows, using their respective package managers. Git can also be [compiled from source and installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_from_source) on any operating system.

For more information about using and configuring Git, see our [Getting Started with Git](/docs/development/version-control/how-to-configure-git/) guide.
