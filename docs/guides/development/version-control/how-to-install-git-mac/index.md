There are different ways to install Git on Mac OSX. You can install Git using Homebrew, MacPorts, or by downloading the Git installer package.

### Check if Git is already installed

1.  Check if Git is already installed on your Mac using:

        git --version

    If Git isnâ€™t installed on your computer, the terminal prompts you with the following message:

    ![The "git" command requires the command line developer tools.](check-if-git-installed-mac-osx.png)

2.  Click on **Install** to install the developer tools required

    These developer tools surrounding Xcode and Xcode app development utilities are available from Apple. Once you follow the prompts and agree to them, at the end of the process you have a working version of Git.


### Install Git using Homebrew on Mac OSX

1.  Execute the following command on your Mac terminal:

        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

2.  Press return once you are prompted. You should see an installation success message once the installation is complete.

3.  The Homebrew version you just installed may not be the most recent stable build. Therefore, it's a good practice to update it. To update Homebrew, enter the following command in your terminal:

        brew update

4.  Finally, to install Git run:

        brew install git
