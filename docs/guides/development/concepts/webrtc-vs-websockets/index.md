[The WebRTC framework](https://webrtc.org/) and [WebSocket Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) are two common technologies used for handling real-time web communications. WebRTC can process true peer-to-peer communications and is the best option for real-time audio and video streams, as well as applications requiring a higher level of security. WebSockets is designed for client-to-server communications and is a good choice for real-time updates or two-way event-driven applications.

This guide compares and contrasts WebRTC and WebSockets, their advantages and disadvantages, and how to choose the proper protocol for your use case.

## Before WebRTC and WebSockets: Polling

Before WebRTC and WebSockets became commonplace, *polling* was frequently used for real-time communications. In polling, the web client sends HTTP requests at regular intervals and waits for a response. When the client receives a response, it refreshes the page to reflect the new data. This process can be resource intensive and inefficient in terms of bandwidth. Often, no new information is available, and nothing is gained by the poll.

*Long polling*, also referred to as the *Comet* protocol, is an optimization to polling. The server holds the request for a set duration and only sends a response when an update is available. Otherwise, it times out and returns an empty request. In addition to having some of the same problems as polling, *Comet* is often error-prone, inefficient, and can be difficult to set up. Both polling and Comet technologies are still used on some web pages, but they have been largely superseded by WebRTC and WebSockets since they have lower latency and are considered more reliable.

## What Is WebRTC?

WebRTC is a free, open-source specification for transmitting high-quality audio and video content directly between peer users. The standard consists of a JavaScript API and several supporting protocols. WebRTC has been standardized by the *World Wide Web Consortium* (W3C) and through the IETF in [RFC 8825](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8825). Many modern platforms and browsers support WebRTC.

-   The WebRTC standard allows developers to integrate multimedia content directly into a browser for direct peer-to-peer transmission. It is used in such applications as online education, torrent services, webcams, home security, telehealth, VoIP telephony, and screen sharing. WebRTC does not require additional plug-ins, server-side file hosting, helper applications, or an intermediate server. However, it does require assistance in establishing the initial connection.

-   The WebRTC JavaScript API is used to access the microphone, camera, screen, and other devices on the system. It also manages the connection and sends, receives, encodes, and decodes data. WebRTC is able to listen for, and respond to, a number of events, including `open`, `close`, and `connectionstatechange`. Additional components of the API handle interactions with the signaling channel, security, and authentication.

-   WebRTC uses a more secure variant of the *Real-time Transport Protocol* (RTP) known as *Secure RTP* (SRTP) to transmit streams. SRTP packets are sent over *User Datagram Protocol* (UDP). UDP has low latency and can tolerate some data loss.

-   WebRTC transmits information using two main channels:
    -   The streaming channel is used for real-time media communications and is designed to transmit audio and video information. A stream contains at least one *track*, but typically contains two or more components. Each media component (i.e. the audio stream) maps to a different track.
    -   A corresponding data channel for sending text or binary files uses the *Stream Control Transmission Protocol* (SCTP). SCTP combines features of both UDP and the *Transmission Control Protocol* (TCP) to ensure reliable ordered delivery of packets with reasonably low latency.

-   To establish the initial peer-to-peer connection, WebRTC must rely on an intermediate signaling server. The protocol is agnostic regarding what signaling service to use. Most implementations use a *Traversal Using Relays around NAT* (TURN) or *Session Traversal Utilities for NAT* (STUN) server to set up the *signal channel*. Peers share connection parameters and advertise their media channels using the *Session Description Protocol* (SDP).

### Advantages and Disadvantages of WebRTC

#### Advantages

- It is an open-source standard that is free to use and has high interoperability.
- It supports high-quality audio and video, with advanced features including noise reduction and echo cancellation.
- It features high performance with low latency and is suitable for real-time applications.
- It can be easy to implement and simplify development work.
- It is widely supported on different platforms and browsers.
- It does not require the user to install plug-ins or other software.
- It supports bandwidth management and can adjust transmission quality on low-speed or low-quality connections.
- It prioritizes security and includes an encryption feature.

#### Disadvantages

- Browsers may not always follow the official specification.
- The underlying technology involves several interrelated components and can be complex and difficult to understand.
- It does not have a quality of service component, and cannot always guarantee real-time transmission at high resolution or frame rates.
- It is suited for one-to-one transmission rather than multi-user scenarios. Many-to-many applications typically require the use of a multimedia server.

## What Is WebSockets?

{{< note title="WebSocket vs. WebSockets" >}}
The terms *WebSocket* and *WebSockets* are often used interchangeably. The official term for the protocol in the RFC is the "WebSocket Protocol". The framework, API, and technology are usually referred to as "WebSockets".
{{< /note >}}

WebSockets is also an open standard protocol for web applications. It enables a persistent full-duplex channel between a client and a server. WebSockets typically runs on a browser on the client side but can use other services. The current WebSockets implementation is defined in [RFC 6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) and is supported on all major browsers, platforms, and web servers.

-   WebSockets run on top of the TCP transport layer. TCP reliably delivers packets in their original order and is designed to be highly compatible with HTTP. Both protocols use ports 80 and 443 and reside at the application layer of the network stack. The WebSockets negotiation process uses the HTTP *upgrade header* to switch over to WebSockets from HTTP. After the client and server both agree to use WebSockets, the session continues to send messages over the existing TCP connection. However, both sides now send messages using the WebSocket Protocol rather than HTTP. WebSocket URLs begin with the `ws` or `wss` prefix.

-   Each WebSockets message is fragmented into frames. The frames have very small headers to reduce overhead and minimize latency. A WebSocket client can determine if the connection involves a proxy and sets up a persistent tunnel if necessary.

-   The full-duplex nature of the connection allows for real-time data to be transmitted between a client and the server. WebSockets maintains an ongoing open connection. This allows messages to be sent and received at any time. The server automatically and proactively "pushes" content to the client without waiting for a request. This makes WebSockets a good choice for fast-changing content such as sports scores and stock prices. It is also used for real-time updates, gaming, collaborative document editing, chatbots, and online help.

-   The WebSocket Protocol offers an event-based API for incorporation into JavaScript or other programming languages. Developers can listen for, and react to, events from the server. Polling is never required. Servers can choose from four different events, including `Open`, `Message`, `Error`, and `Close`.

For more information on WebSockets, including how to create and use a socket, see our [Introduction to WebSockets](/docs/guides/introduction-to-websockets/) guide. The [Mozilla WebSockets documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) contains technical details about the web API.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of WebSockets

#### Advantages

- It allows for ongoing bidirectional communication between a client and a server. The connection is full-duplex, so both the client and server can simultaneously send messages.
- It sends updates quickly with low latency and overhead.
- It does not force the client to send repeated HTTP requests.
- It maintains the same session instead of creating new connections, reducing load on the web server.
- It works with HTTP and is therefore available on most modern platforms and browsers.

#### Disadvantages

- It can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting and hijacking attempts unless extra protection is added.
- It is meant for sending self-contained messages rather than for streaming.
- WebSocket sessions do not automatically reconnect after an error. Some WebSocket-based applications can suffer from reliability problems.
- It can be more complex to use than traditional HTTP polling.
- It does not include a caching mechanism.

## What are the Similarities and Differences Between WebRTC and WebSockets?

### Similarities

On the surface, WebRTC and WebSockets are more alike than they are different, and in many cases workable applications can be built on top of either technology.

- **Main purpose and use case**: WebRTC and WebSockets are both useful for ongoing two-way communications and are both widely used in web applications.
- **Standardization**: Both features are open-source technologies and follow an official standard. They are free to use and do not require any license, add-ons, plug-ins, or supporting applications.
- **Latency and performance**: Both are low-latency applications with little overhead and are designed for efficiency.
- **Interoperability**: Both frameworks are largely browser, server, and platform independent.
- **API**: Both WebRTC and WebSockets include a web API for inclusion in JavaScript code or other web programming languages.

### Differences

The WebRTC and WebSocket protocols follow different architectural models, and as a result, they have different strengths and weaknesses.

- **Architectural model**: WebSockets is only designed for client-server communications. Two peers can not communicate directly without passing messages through an intermediate server. WebRTC is a true peer-to-peer protocol. It requires help with signaling, but after the connection is established, the peers can talk directly to each other. Data does not have to pass through a central server.
- **Transport layer protocols**: WebSockets and WebRTC use different transport layer protocols. WebSockets uses TCP to guarantee reliable in-sequence delivery and data integrity. WebRTC transmits real-time media using Secure RTP over UDP. UDP is fast but does not guarantee delivery of all packets and it does not retransmit lost packets.
- **Speed vs. reliability**: Both applications are fairly fast, but WebRTC explicitly prioritizes speed and low latency. It does not guarantee the delivery of all packets and is tolerant of some data loss. WebSockets attempts to deliver all packets in order. It is a good choice for transmitting text and binary files where packet loss is unacceptable.
- **Media processing and peripherals**: WebRTC provides direct access to devices, including screens, microphones, video cameras, and tablets. The WebSockets API is not capable of handling device inputs directly. WebRTC has very sophisticated media processing and codec features, which WebSockets largely lacks. For instance, WebRTC can adjust transmission quality based on the speed and congestion rate of the connection. It also includes features for noise reduction and echo cancellation.
- **Security**: WebRTC is considered more secure than WebSockets. WebRTC messages are encrypted and authenticated. WebSocket messages can be vulnerable to certain attacks and hijacking attempts.
- **Integration and Ease of Use**: WebSockets integrate better with HTTP and can be easier to understand. It uses fewer resources and does not require assistance with signaling as WebRTC does. For a widely-used WebRTC application, it may be necessary to pay for one or more signaling servers to initiate and manage the connections. Smaller sites may be able to manage using free STUN/TURN servers.
- **Maturity**: WebSockets is more mature and is currently used by more applications than WebRTC.

## How To Choose Between WebRTC vs WebSockets

Due to their differences, WebRTC and WebSockets have varying optimal use cases. WebRTC specializes in real-time streaming media, and WebSockets is designed to handle real-time updates.

### When To Use and Not Use WebRTC

- WebRTC is better suited for all audio or video communications, as well as streaming real-time media. It is the natural choice for movies and music and can handle specialty applications such as screen sharing, live broadcasting, or bidirectional live feeds. WebSockets is not designed for these tasks.
- Since WebRTC has very low latency and minimizes jitter, it is the better choice for applications like VoIP that cannot handle any delay.
- WebRTC is the better technology for bidirectional video applications, including e-learning, telehealth, and video calls.
- WebRTC maintains two data channels, so it is particularly good for applications that want to send media alongside meta-information. For example: A music streaming site where song lyrics and production information are sent alongside the audio track.
- WebRTC is recommended whenever security is important, like in telehealth or other sensitive exchanges.
- Although WebRTC can send text and files using the data channel, this is not what it is really intended for. It is not as reliable a choice for text and binary files as WebSockets.
- In collaborative editing, WebRTC is more susceptible to editing conflicts than WebSockets.
- WebRTC does not treat updates as events, and it does not guarantee reliable delivery. It is not the right choice for any monitoring or dashboard application designed to respond to critical events.

### When To Use and Not Use WebSockets

- WebSockets is the better framework for sending unidirectional real-time updates and notifications. It works especially well in conjunction with the JSON format to define a custom API for use by the server and its users. Updates should be presented as separate stand-alone messages.
- It is a good choice for message-based applications, including chats, online quizzes, and dashboards. It is recommended for event-driven environments that must react to certain notifications and alerts.
- WebSockets is particularly good for live feeds, such as stock tickers, sports scoreboards, and social media feeds. Use WebSockets when the information updates frequently, but not constantly.
- Because WebSockets sends asynchronous updates, it is the better option for collaborative document editing or coding. Updates are ordered events with timestamps, so conflicts can be easily resolved.
- It has limited multimedia capabilities. Along with text and binary files, WebSockets can handle images and short videos.
- WebSockets is better for low-quality or unstable connections. The TCP connection retransmits packets and does not time out immediately.
- WebSockets is not optimized for streaming media like movies, music, and webcams.

### Other Considerations

WebRTC and WebSockets can be used together. Since WebRTC requires assistance with signaling and session creation, WebSockets can establish this connection using an intermediate server. WebRTC does not specify how to handle signaling, so it can work with a variety of technologies, including WebSockets.

Neither application handles one-to-many broadcasts or many-to-many multicast scenarios very well on its own. Many-to-many applications require a dedicated multimedia server to assemble the streams. WebRTC can be used as a building block alongside a media server.
