Functional programming has a lot to offer, though you might hear it talked about less frequently. It is ideal for program transparency, for concurrency, and for debugging.

So, when should you use functional programming, and what are some specific benefits it offers? Find out in this tutorial. Learn what functional programming is, what its benefits are, and what the best use cases are to make the most of it.

## What is Functional Programming?

In functional programming, everything is designed around functions and with the ideal of avoiding side effects. Functional programming centers on program behavior, rather than on objects and those objects' states. And functional programming aims to keep these behaviors as predictable as it can.

You can dive deep learning more about what makes functional programming what it is, including elaboration of its core principles, in our guide *Functional Programming: Paradigm for Application & Composition*.

To summarize, what follows is a brief look at functional programming's central concepts to give you a clearer idea of how it can operate.

- First-class functions. Functions are treated like any other data type, and are capable of being used as arguments. This ties to the idea of *referential transparency*, meaning any expression, including functions, can be replaced with a value and generate the same results.

- Pure functions. A pure function is one in which the only determiner of a function's output is the function's direct input. Such functions are not impacted by and do not generate side effects. They make program behavior much more predictable and easier to reason about.

- Immutability. Values, once set, should not or cannot be altered. Again, this makes functional programs much more predictable, and often it makes for cleaner and more consistent program logic.

## What is Functional Programming Used For?

Functional programming can operate in many contexts. In most cases, it is just as capable as a paradigm like object-oriented programming. There are some applications that are not well-suited to functional programming, but mostly functional programming just brings a different focus to application design.

One of the big draws of functional programming, however, is concurrency. Because functional programs are designed around predictable functions and because these functions avoid side effects, functional programming lends to concurrent operations. You can learn more about this further below.

Otherwise, developers tend to use functional programming when they want to focus on making programs:

- Testable. Functional programming makes program behavior more consistent and predictable. This tends to make debugging tasks more straightforward. And the design of immutability and pure functions often makes it such that functional programming can avoid most or all run-time bugs.

- Behavior-oriented. Functional programming breaks programs down by actions, rather than by objects. This is especially useful in programs that deal with complex operations as opposed to complex objects.

- Clearer. Functional programming often results in clearer, more readable code. Predictability and immutability help with this. And not only do these features make programs clearer for developers.

## Benefits of Functional Programming

Functional programming, as mentioned above, can be used in a wide range of contexts. But it also has particular benefits that set it apart. Knowing these can help you to decide when functional programming is the right choice for your needs.

This section breaks down some of the key benefits of using functional programming. The list here is not exhaustive, but it covers the biggest draws for functional programming. These benefits have been categorized broadly to show the big picture of what functional programming has to offer.

### Predictability

Functional programming makes program behaviors more predictable through the elimination of side effects. The use of pure functions, which do not rely on or create side effects, makes anticipating the output of functions easier. It eliminates the need for developers to track external states that might impact various functions.

Often, functional programming's predictability makes functional programs easier to test, since tests can be run on functions independently. Pure functions' outputs are determined solely by their inputs, which makes it possible to test each function independently to ensure accuracy in your program.

The predictability baked into functional programming thus tends to reduce the number of bugs. And this is not just the case for developers. Compilers, too, are able to leverage the predictability of functional programs to catch would-be bugs at compile time. In this way, many compilers for functional programming languages, like Elm, can boast few-to-no run-time bugs.

### Reasonability

Functional programming being reasonable does not mean that functional programming is somehow more rational. It means, instead, that functional programs tend to be easier to reason about, a feature tied to predictability and clarity as well.

Functional programs avoid side effects, meaning that what a function does depends only on that function's input. This facilitates developers' ability to navigate through program logic, since that logic is not affected by states that change in difficult-to-track ways.

Instead, developers can focus on specific behaviors or parts of behaviors. They can rigorously test those parts independently with assurance that, if the function behaves as expected independently, it does so in all circumstances.

Functional programming can thus be a boon for debugging. The fact that functional programs' logic is easier to reasonable and to test makes functional programming excellent fit for programs that require complex behaviors. Programs, for instance, that have complex logic for processing data, like many financial application, can be handled more deftly with functional programming.

Functional programming logic also tends to be simpler, in a mathematical sense. Recursion is an example. Recursion can be difficult to learn at first, but, once learned, it offers clean and succinct logical expressions.

### Concurrency

Concurrency is one of the major reasons for using functional programming in enterprise contexts. And, once again, the strength of this feature in functional programming is thanks to pure functions.

Pure functions are thread safe, a difficult but highly-desired feature for programs that need to run concurrent operations. Recall that pure functions determine output solely based on function input. In other words, a pure function does not use or create side effects in the program. Thread safety is a guarantee that two processes running in parallel do not affect the same data. And pure functions, by their nature, include that guarantee.

For context, thread safety can be difficult to come by in object-oriented programming. This is, at least in part, because object-oriented programs tend to rely heavily on object states for program actions. States by their nature tend to promote side effects, which, in turn, make it incredibly difficult to guarantee thread safety.

### Clarity

Functional programs tend to be more readable. This feature is shown in the discussion of functional programming's predictability and reasonableness above, but its clarity bears mentioning on its own too.

Overall, functional programming promotes transparency in all operations and expressions. Whether you look at its use of pure functions, avoidance of side effects, or immutability, functional programming ultimately gives developers a better time navigating code. Large and complex applications in other paradigms can make working through application logic and debugging tedious an time consuming. Functional programming's ability to isolate and simplify logic is in large part what makes it stand out from the perspective of developer experience.

Functional programming also, because of its basis in and use of lambda calculus, tends to be more concise. Each line of code in a functional program tends to be doing more than in paradigms like procedural. This conciseness can make navigating and finding the relevant portions of code much quicker.

## Limitations of Functional Programming

Functional programming is not perfect for every situation or programming need. In fact, there are some case when it would be inadvisable to use functional programming.

The following are a few points to give you an idea of factors that may advise you against functional programming in particular use cases.

- Memory usage. Functional programming makes heavy use of recursive functions and immutable variables. Both of these work well when your goal is promoting transparency in your program operations. But both of them also lead to programs with higher memory usage than comparable programs in procedural or object-oriented paradigms.

- Behavior focus. Functional programming centers program design on program behavior. Doing so makes sense for programs with complex logic. However, some application contexts strongly favor programs that put objects at the center. This is often the case with business applications and user interfaces, where object-oriented programs are the natural choice. This is not to say that functional programming cannot fit these needs — it certainly has. But functional programming does not lend itself to them as naturally.

- Learning curve. Functional programming can be clear, predictable, and concise. But it can be an up-hill battle to learn it well enough for these benefits to be seen. Functional programming often makes use of logic that might be unfamiliar to developers used to procedural and object-oriented paradigms.

## Conclusion

This above should provide you with a firm grasp on the benefits functional programming has to offer. It includes what you need to know to decide when to use, and when not to use, functional programming. With this information, you are ready to start learning more about functional programming and getting the most out of it.
