Yarn is a package manager designed to be a more performant alternative to NPM for managing your Node.js project's dependencies. Learn more about Yarn, how it stacks up against NPM, and how to get started using it in this guide.

## Before You Begin

1. Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/getting-started/) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

1. This guide uses `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [How to Secure Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server/) guide to create a standard user account, harden SSH access, and remove unnecessary network services.

1. Update your system.

    - On Debian and Ubuntu, run the following command:

            sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

    - On AlmaLinux and CentOS, use:

            sudo yum update

{{< note >}}
The steps in this guide are written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Linux Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## Yarn vs NPM

The Yarn package manager uses the NPM registry, so it maintains access to all of the packages available through NPM. And Yarn's commands are generally similar to NPM's. So what sets Yarn apart?

Yarn's chief advantage over NPM is its speed. Originally, Yarn was created to address performance and security concerns in NPM. Since then, NPM has made significant changes to address security concerns and even improved its performance. But, nonetheless, Yarn remains far, and away faster than NPM.

Yarn's performance advantage makes it especially useful for projects where installation speed is a factor. Large projects, for instance, can be more quickly set up on new machines, with dependencies installing in a fraction of the time needed by NPM. Projects that require automated installation, too, can make good use of Yarn's performance.

Yarn has also prioritized user-friendliness. Its output tends to be clear and straightforward, in contrast to the often verbose and difficult-to-decipher output from NPM.

Yarn previously had an advantage with its `yarn.lock` file. Yarn creates this file by default when adding packages to a project. The file tracks exact package versions installed and their installation order to ensure consistent versioning and file structure when installing project dependencies. But NPM, taking inspiration from Yarn, has recently added its own lock file, `package-lock.json`. It works similarly to Yarn's and brings the two package managers essentially to an even playing field when it comes to lock files.

## How to Install Yarn

1. Follow the steps for installing NPM in our [How to Install and Use Node Package Manager (NPM) on Linux](/docs/guides/install-and-use-npm-on-linux/#how-to-install-npm) guide.

1. Install Yarn using NPM. The `-g` flag has NPM install Yarn as a global package, rather than a project package.

        npm install -g yarn

1. Verify the installation.

        yarn --version

## Install, Remove, and Modify Packages with Yarn

This section shows you how to work with packages using Yarn.

Most of the time, you want Yarn to help you work with packages for a specific project. You can use the commands below to create a project directory and initialize a Yarn project as an example to follow along within this guide.

    mkdir ~/example-app
    cd ~/example-app
    yarn init

Yarn prompts you for information about the project. You can use the defaults for this example. The result is an initial `package.json` file representing the project. For more on the `package.json`, take a look at the section for it in our [How to Install and Use Node Package Manager (NPM) on Linux](/docs/guides/install-and-use-npm-on-linux/#packagejson) guide.

### How to Install a Package with Yarn

The easiest way to install a package with Yarn is the `add` command followed by the name of the package. This example installs the latest stable version of the TailwindCSS package.

    yarn add tailwindcss

You can, alternatively, specify the exact version of the package you want Yarn to install.

    yarn add tailwindcss@2.2.7

This method even lets you specify a version range. Just wrap the version part of the expression in quotations, and precede the version with the relevant comparison operators. You can separate multiple versions constraints with spaces.

    yarn add tailwindcss@">2.2.0 <=2.2.7"

The above command installs the latest available version of TailwindCSS that is greater than **2.2.0** and equal to or less than **2.2.7**.

For any of the above commands, Yarn updates the `package.json` file with the package information. This example shows the `package.json` resulting from the version range command:

{{< output >}}
{
  "name": "example-yarn-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "tailwindcss": ">2.2.0 <=2.2.7"
  }
}
{{< /output >}}

Finally, if you are trying to install dependencies for an existing project, with its own `package.json`, just run the following command in the base directory:

    yarn install

### How to Remove a Package with Yarn

You can uninstall a Yarn package with the `remove` command.

    yarn remove tailwindcss

As with the `add` command, Yarn here also updates the `package.json` to reflect the removed package.

{{< output >}}
{
  "name": "example-yarn-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {}
}
{{< /output >}}

### How to Update Packages with Yarn

You can use the command below to update all of a project's packages to their latest compatible versions.

    yarn upgrade

The update utilizes the version numbers or ranges given in the `package.json` file for the project so that the updates do not conflict with your specified package versions for the project.

### Yarn Global

Packages can also be managed at a global level. These packages are not associated with a particular project, so they can be accessed across your system and outside of a project context.

You can install a package globally using the `global` command followed by the `add` command you would use to install the package otherwise.

    yarn global add tailwindcss@2.2.7

To uninstall a package that you installed globally, likewise use the `global` command followed by the `remove` command.

    yarn global remove tailwindcss

Finally, you can also use the `upgrade` command globally, as in:

    yarn global upgrade
