Rust and Go are two fast programming languages and compelling modern alternatives to languages like C/C++. Best of all, they bring built-in concurrency models to readily take advantage of multiple CPUs.

But which one is best, Rust vs Go? And, more importantly, which one is right for you?

This tutorial helps you answer those questions. Follow along to learn the core characteristics of each language and their strengths and weaknesses. By the end, grasp what contexts each shines in and where you can make the most of them.

## What is Golang (Go)?

[Go](https://go.dev/), also known as Golang, is an open-source, statically-typed, compiled programming language created by Google developers. Go aims to fill the role of the C programming language, but with an emphasis on safety, simplicity, and readability in addition to performance efficiency.

Go keeps much of the performance of C. But it compliments that with features like memory safety and garbage collection, making Go programs easier to work on and to keep secure.

Go is, in many ways, also similar to C syntactically. However, Go forges ahead to take many cues from modern programming languages with an emphasis on readability. The result is a syntax that rings familiar to C veterans but is more approachable and easier to maintain.

Additionally, Go adds built-in support for concurrency to its list of features. Its "Goroutines" provide a simple and accessible method for creating and managing subroutines. This makes Go exceptional when it comes to applications with parallel processing and asynchronous processes.

## What is Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is an open-source, multi-paradigm programming language. Like Go, Rust resembles C/C++, but Rust was particularly designed with performance and reliability at the forefront.

Rust combines low-level, systems programming features, like memory management, with high-level features, like functional-programming principles. And Rust has some of the best performance of any programming language. All this, while guaranteeing memory safety, in contrast to languages like C/C++.

One of Rust's highlights is its ability to maintain memory safety without relying on the often burdensome garbage collection. Instead, Rust uses a *borrow checker*, which validates references at compile time. Not only does this keep Rust memory safe, but does so without the substantial performance impacts usually incurred by garbage collection.

Like Go, Rust also comes with built-in support for concurrency. While its concurrency model is, under the covers, more complicated, it is able to maintain Rust's high performance while still guaranteeing safety in concurrent operations.

## Golang vs Rust: What’s the Difference?

How do Rust and Go stack up when it comes to features and usage? These next several sections break that question down, looking comparatively at each of these programming languages over several key areas.

### Application

The choice between Rust and Go often comes down to the application you are working on and the particular problems you want to solve.

Go excels at compiling code, as the section below, on performance, explains. This makes Go a good choice when you expect to have a large codebase and a large team working on it. In these cases, Go's quick compilation time saves teams time and vastly improves developer experience over slower-compiling languages.

On top of that, Go has top-notch built-in support for HTTP. This and Go's general orientation toward web development make it a strong choice for web applications. You can consider using Go where you might normally find something like Node.js. And Go, because it is a compiled language, brings to the table a higher level of performance over many of these other web-oriented languages.

Rust prioritizes secure performance over all else, which is elaborated in the section below on performance. This makes Rust a compelling choice when it comes to applications with complex algorithms and large amounts of data to process. In tests, Rust tends to hold its remarkable performance through complex operations and high levels of abstraction, so few other languages compare when speed is the premium.

Rust also performs close to the metal—that is, close to machine components. Its low-level efficiencies and fine-grained control make it an outstanding option for systems programming. Add to that its modern sensibilities and its ability to guarantee memory safety without performance compromises, and you can see how it may outshine C/C++ in this field.

### Ease of Use

This category is where the two languages most strongly differ. And that is largely because each works off of a different set of principles when it comes to what the language wants to accomplish.

Go sets developer experience at the forefront. In fact, its designers intended to make a streamlined alternative to the complexity that had grown into C over the years. To that end, Go has a simplified and approachable syntax. The language is easier to read and comes more intuitively, making it more straightforward to maintain and for a team to work on collaboratively.

Go also comes with a limited set of features by default. The intention here is to only include what is necessary, while giving developers a robust system for importing external packages as needed.

Rust, by contrast, forefronts speed and control over usability. In other words, it is performance oriented rather than developer oriented. While Rust comes away with blazing-fast run-time speeds and first-in-class safety, it has a steep learning curve and demands developers engage with and be mindful of memory usage and security. It tends to be that Rust requires more code per task than a language like Go.

### Performance

Up front, both Go and Rust are fast. They fit into the category of efficient compiled languages like C/C++, and have the performance levels that come with that category of languages.

However, when it comes to run-time speed, Rust wins out. It prioritizes low-level efficiencies and speeds near machines' limits. And it accomplishes this while maintaining memory safety, making it an excellent alternative when you want C/C++ speeds but stronger memory guarantees. Of course, as mentioned above, the achievement comes at the cost of some ease of use, but, when run-time performance is your priority, Rust brings some of the best around.

Go's performance shines in a different arena. With Go, run-time speeds do not reach the level of Rust. However, Go has some of the fastest compile times of any programming language. This is what makes Go an especially compelling choice for large codebases and for distributed teams, where the ability to shave off compilation time is more valuable. Go allows developers to have code running in a fraction of the time needed for most other compiled programming languages.

Both languages also have highly-developed concurrency models, which makes them effective for scaling applications. The same differences in characteristics apply as with other aspects of these languages. Go prioritizes simplicity and usability in its concurrency model, while Rust prioritizes memory safety—a challenging task for concurrency operations.

## Rust vs Go: When to Use Each

Both Rust and Go have strong built-in support for concurrency, but, otherwise, each has its own advantages and particular use cases it is best suited to. Overall, look to Go when you need something that is developer-centered, improving developer experience and efficiency. Turn to Rust when you need something machine centered, sharpening performance and reliability.

Keep reading through the next two sections to get detailed perspectives on when and where each of these languages works best.

### When Go Is Best

Go works exceptionally well for large codebases and where your want to put readability at the forefront. This is often the case with large, complex applications like you might find in enterprise contexts. And Go's simplicity makes it a great tool for distributed teams, where you expect numerous developers to be working on the codebase without much other contact.

Go also stands out for applying its aesthetic of simplicity to concurrency. With Go, concurrency is made more straightforward and manageable. This makes it an excellent choice for distributed applications.

### When Rust Is Best

Rust runs closer to the low-level machine components. For that reason, Rust is the go-to choice when it comes to systems programming and applications where speed is one of the foremost priorities. Rust has many of the sensibilities of modern programming languages, including high-level features like those leveraged for functional programming, while fitting low-level roles previously dominated by C/C++.

Rust also brings memory safety with its speed. This makes it an especially good choice for applications where you might otherwise use C/C++ but are looking to have more safety and security.

## Conclusion

With that, you have what you need to start making a decision between these two outstanding languages. Indeed, they both stand out in their own ways, so your choice should come down to which one best fits your particular needs. As this tutorial has shown, follow Go for a streamlined and simplified developer-centered experience. Choose Rust for intense speed and memory safety.
