description: "Clojure is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. It is a dialect of the Lisp programming language running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While Clojure allows you to write elegant and concise code, its ability to make use of the existing JVM infrastructure, such as libraries, tools and application servers, makes it also a very practical choice."
