Even eight years after its release, the Zombie Horde Survival game [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com/) (7DTD) is still going strong. Its community is active and the zombie fun hasn't stopped. The game is even better when you and your friends play on your own server, using your own rules. Plus, when you [host a game server yourself](/docs/guides/get-started-with-linux-game-server-hosting), you don't have to worry about lag time that can interrupt your gameplay. This guide shows you how to set up your own 7DTD server, using LinuxGSM.

## Before You Begin

1. Deploy an **Ubuntu 20.04** Linode in a [data center region](https://www.linode.com/global-infrastructure/) close to your player's geographic location. Ensure you select a [Linode plan](/docs/guides/choosing-a-compute-instance-plan/) with enough RAM and CPU for the game. The [7 Days to Die official documentation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/251570/7_Days_to_Die/) recommends 4 CPU cores.

1.  Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

In order to play 7 Days to Die, you have to [purchase the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/251570/7_Days_to_Die/).

## Deploy a Game Server Using LinuxGSM

The Linux Game Server manager ([LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com/)) is a command-line tool that helps you deploy and configure your game server. With a few scripts, it helps you to fine-tune your 7 Days to Die instance. This section shows you how to install LinuxGSM and 7 Days to Die on your Ubuntu 20.04 server.

1. Install the LinuxGSM dependencies and Steam:

        sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install curl wget file tar bzip2 gzip unzip bsdmainutils python util-linux ca-certificates binutils bc jq tmux netcat lib32gcc-s1 lib32stdc++6 steamcmd telnet expect

    A prompt appears with the Steam EULA. To proceed, use your keyboard's **down arrow** key to read through the agreement. Then, use the **tab** key to select **<ok>**.

1. Create a 7 Days to Die Server system user, and add the user to the `sudo` group, and switch.

        sudo adduser sdtdserver
        sudo adduser sdtdserver sudo

1. Switch your terminal session to the new `sdtdserver` user. You can exit your current session by typing **exit**, then [SSH into your Linode](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/#update-your-systems-hosts-filelog-in-using-ssh) using as the `sdtdserver` user. Ensure you replace the example command with your [Linode's IP address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/).

        ssh sdtdserver@192.0.2.0

1. Download LinuxGSM:

        sudo wget -O linuxgsm.sh https://linuxgsm.sh && sudo chmod +x linuxgsm.sh && bash linuxgsm.sh sdtdserver

    Your output resembles the following:
