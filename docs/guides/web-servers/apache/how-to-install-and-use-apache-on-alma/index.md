[*AlmaLinux OS*](https://almalinux.org/) is a stable open-source Linux distribution that provides a new alternative to CentOS. As a downstream fork of the *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* (RHEL) codebase, AlmaLinux guarantees ongoing free availability. CloudLinux experts originally built and designed AlmaLinux, but it is now a community-led project. AlmaLinux supports the same software applications that CentOS does, including the [*Apache web server*](https://www.apache.org/). This guide explains how to install, configure, and use Apache on AlmaLinux.

## Advantages of AlmaLinux

As a potential replacement for CentOS, AlmaLinux provides many attractive selling points and features.

- It is fairly quick and easy to migrate from CentOS to AlmaLinux with no significant downtime.
- AlmaLinux supports the same software that CentOS does, and is compatible with all CentOS services and applications.
- The current 8.3 version is supported until 2029, with thoroughly tested updates and security patches throughout this period.
- AlmaLinux is a free open source product with no licenses or restrictions.
- The user community owns and governs AlmaLinux. AlmaLinux receives sponsorship funds from CloudLinux Inc., which guarantees its viability.
- It is based on the CloudLinux OS, an RHEL fork that has existed for over ten years. AlmaLinux is a 1:1 binary fork of RHEL.

## Before You Begin

1. Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/getting-started/) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

1. This guide uses `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of Linode's guide on [How to Secure Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server/) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do **not** follow the *Configure a Firewall* section yet as this guide includes firewall rules specifically for an OpenVPN server.

1. Update your system:

        sudo dnf update

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for non-root users. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Linux Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## Install and Enable the Apache Web Server on AlmaLinux

To proceed with the Apache installation, AlmaLinux must already be installed. Instructions for switching to AlmaLinux can be found at their [GitHub site](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy).

1. Verify whether there are any updates, using the `dnf check-update` command. If any updates are available, update the Linode. If any kernel components are updated, reboot the Linode.

        sudo dnf check-update
        sudo dnf update
        sudo reboot

1. Install the necessary Apache packages.

        sudo dnf install httpd httpd-tools

1. Apache does not start automatically when it is installed. Start and enable it using the `systemctl` utility.

        sudo systemctl start httpd

1. **(Optional)** To restart Apache every time the system reboots, enable it in `systemctl`.

        sudo systemctl enable httpd
    {{< output >}}
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service.
    {{< /output >}}

1. Verify the status of `Apache` using `systemctl status`. It should be `active` and display a status of `running`.

        sudo systemctl status httpd
    {{< output >}}
httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; enabled; vendor prese>
Active: active (running) since Fri 2021-06-04 13:07:16 UTC; 4min 52s ago
Docs: man:httpd.service(8)
Main PID: 5933 (httpd)
Status: "Running, listening on: port 80"
    {{< /output >}}

## Configure the AlmaLinux Firewall to Allow Apache Connections

The `firewalld` service is already installed and enabled as part of AlmaLinux. Additional configuration is required to allow Apache connections to pass through the firewall.

{{< note >}}
It is strongly recommended that you keep the firewall turned on.

- To temporarily disable the firewall to debug a problem, enter the command `sudo systemctl stop firewalld`.
- The firewall can be restarted using the `sudo systemctl start firewalld` command.
- To disable it permanently, use the `sudo systemctl disable firewalld` command.
{{< /note >}}

1. Use `systemctl` to verify whether `firewalld` is already enabled.

        sudo systemctl status firewalld
    {{< output >}}
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled; vendor p>
Active: active (running) since Fri 2021-06-04 11:15:33 UTC; 2h 22min ago
    {{< /output >}}

1. Add rules to allow Apache HTTP and HTTPS connections through the firewall.

        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent

1. Reload `firewalld` to apply the changes.

        sudo firewall-cmd --reload

1. Confirm that the applications have been registered.

        sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
    {{< output >}}
public (active)
  target: default
  ...
  services: cockpit dhcpv6-client http https ssh
  ...
    {{< /output >}}

{{< note >}}
In addition to `firewalld`, the security application SELinux comes pre-loaded with AlmaLinux. Under certain conditions, the two applications might conflict with one another. Verify the status of SELinux using the `sestatus` command. SELinux can be temporarily disabled for debugging purposes using the `sudo setenforce 0` command.

## Test the Apache Web Server and Host a Web Page

1. Verify that the Apache server is working as expected. Visit the IP address of the Linode using a web browser. If everything is configured properly, you should see the `AlmaLinux Test Page` landing page.

    ![Apache on AlmaLinux landing page](ApacheLandingPage.png)

1. The location for the default web page for the server is `/var/www/html`. If this directory is empty, Apache displays the test page from `/etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf`. If your website has a home page, in this case, `index.html`, copy it into the `/var/www/html` directory.

        cp path-to-home-page/index.html /var/www/html

   {{< note >}}
If you do not have an `index.html` file in `/var/www/html` directory, you can create one. This is to confirm that the web server is serving the page from this directory.
{{< /note >}}

1. SELinux is configured to block web access to this directory. Use the `chcon` command to change the security context for the directory to ensure the web page is accessible.

        chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html

1. Navigate to the IP address of the Linode again. You should now see the web page contents for the home page of your domain.

1. **(Optional)** You should ideally create a virtual host for each site on the server. For more information on creating virtual hosts on Apache, consult the Linode guide on [Apache Configuration Basics](/docs/guides/apache-configuration-basics/).

## Learn More About AlmaLinux

AlmaLinux documentation is still evolving, but the [*AlmaLinux Wiki*](https://wiki.almalinux.org/#about) contains links to several resources along with release notes and a FAQ.
