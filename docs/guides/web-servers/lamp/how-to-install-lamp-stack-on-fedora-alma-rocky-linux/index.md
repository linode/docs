The most common web architecture for Linux-based systems is the [*LAMP Stack*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)). This stack includes all necessary components for a web application, including an operating system, web server, relational database, and programming language. This guide explains how to install and test a LAMP stack on the Fedora Linux platform and the related AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux distributions.

## What is a LAMP Stack?

The LAMP stack is a core architecture for the open source Linux environment. LAMP is an acronym standing for Linux, [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/), and [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Perl](https://www.perl.org), or [Python](https://www.python.org). This software stack is sufficient to support most modern web sites and applications, including WordPress.

The main LAMP stack components are as follows:

-   **Linux**: Linux is a free and open source UNIX-based operating system. It is available in several distinct implementations, called *distributions*. This guide uses Fedora, one of the most popular distributions. The same instructions in this guide are also applicable to the similar AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux platforms. Both of these alternatives are binary-compatible with Fedora. Each distribution of Linux has its own software library which includes the other LAMP stack components.

-   **Apache**: The open source Apache web server is the most common Linux web server. The Apache Software Foundation produces the free standard edition, containing all components required to host a web site. However, extra modules enable additional features such as authentication and programming language APIs.

-   **MariaDB/MySQL**: MySQL and MariaDB are free and open source *relational database management systems* (RDBMS). They can be used interchangeably in the LAMP Stack. MariaDB is a fork of the original MySQL code with additional features, higher scalability, and faster query speed.

-   **PHP/Perl/Python**: PHP is the main server-side scripting and programming language for the LAMP stack. PHP commands can be efficiently embedded within an HTML page, making it a very useful language for web development. It also powers many common open source web applications. PHP is available for free under the PHP License. See the [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/docs.php) for usage instructions. Alternatives to PHP include Perl and Python.

All of these applications are available in the core Fedora software library.

## Before You Begin

1.  If you have not already done so, create a Linode account and Compute Instance. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/) and [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/) guides.

1.  Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you are not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

{{< note >}}
The commands, file contents, and other instructions provided throughout this guide may include placeholders. These are typically domain names, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and other values that are unique to you. The table below identifies these placeholder values and explains what to replace them with:

| Placeholders: | Replace With: |
| -- | -- |
| `EXAMPLE_DOMAIN`| Your custom domain name. |
| `EXAMPLE_USER` | Your MariaDB (or MySQL) username. |
| `EXAMPLE_PASSWORD`| Your MariaDB (or MySQL) user password. |
| `RELEASE_NUMBER` | The desired release number of PHP (optional). |

## How to Install a LAMP Stack on Fedora

These instructions are designed for Fedora 38, but work for AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux as well. The guide provides alternate commands whenever the process differs between distributions.

### How to Install the Apache Web Server

1.  Ensure the system is updated:

    ```command
    sudo dnf upgrade
    sudo dnf update
    ```

1.  Install the Apache web server:

    ```command
    sudo dnf install httpd -y
    ```

1.  Start and enable the web server. The `enable` command automatically launches Apache when the system reboots.

    ```command
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    ```

1.  Use `systemctl` to ensure the web server is `active (running)`:

    ```command
    systemctl status httpd
    ```

    ```output
    ● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
         Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; enabled; preset: di>
        Drop-In: /usr/lib/systemd/system/service.d
                 └─10-timeout-abort.conf
         Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-08-28 12:20:09 EDT; 47s ago
    ```

    Press the <kbd>Q</kbd> key to exit the `systemctl status` output and return to the terminal prompt.

1.  Configure the firewall settings to allow HTTP and HTTPS connections:

    ```command
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
    ```

    ```output
    success
    success
    ```

1.  Reload the firewall:

    ```command
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

    ```output
    success
    ```

1.  Open a Web browser and navigate to the IP address of the Fedora system. It should display the default "Fedora Webserver Test Page":

    ![The default Fedora web landing page](Fedora-default-web-page.png)

    This indicates the web server is working but has not been fully configured yet. The AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux distributions have their own web server test pages which are similar but slightly different.

    {{< note >}}
    If the connection is blocked, it could be due to the default *Security-Enhanced Linux* (SELinux) settings. SELinux is a kernel security module packaged with several Linux distributions. The default security setting is the fairly restrictive `enforcing` mode. To reduce the security level, change the mode to `permissive` using the following command:

    ```command
    sudo setenforce 0
    sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config
    ```
    {{< /note >}}

    {{< note type="secondary" title="Optional" >}}
    If a domain name is pointing to the server, it can be added to the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` file for better performance.

    1.  Open the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` in a text editor with root permissions:

        ```command
        sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        ```

    1.  Add the following information to the end of file and be sure to replace `EXAMPLE_DOMAIN` with your fully-qualified domain name:

        ```file {title="/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"}
        ServerAdmin admin@EXAMPLE_DOMAIN
        ServerName  EXAMPLE_DOMAIN:80
        ```

    1.  When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

    1.  Restart the web server:

        ```command
        sudo systemctl restart httpd
        ```

    1.  Open a Web browser and navigate to your domain name. The browser should now display the default Fedora web server page.

### How to Install the MariaDB Database

This guide installs MariaDB as the database, but the LAMP stack can also use MySQL. MariaDB is an increasingly popular fork of the original MySQL application with some performance advantages.

{{< note >}}
To install MySQL instead of MariaDB, replace the first command with `sudo dnf install mysql-server`, then follow the other instructions. To run the `mysql_secure_installation` script in MySQL, first add a new password for the root account.
{{< /note >}}

1.  Install the MariaDB server:

    ```command
    sudo dnf install mariadb-server -y
    ```

1.  Enable and start MariaDB:

    ```command
    sudo systemctl enable mariadb
    sudo systemctl start mariadb
    ```

1.  Verify the status of MariaDB by running the `systemctl status` command to confirm it is `active`:

    ```command
    sudo systemctl status mariadb
    ```

    ```output
    ● mariadb.service - MariaDB 10.5 database server
         Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service; enabled; preset:>
        Drop-In: /usr/lib/systemd/system/service.d
                 └─10-timeout-abort.conf
         Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-08-28 13:20:57 EDT; 24s ago
    ```

    Press the <kbd>Q</kbd> key to exit the status output and return to the terminal prompt.

1.  To secure the database, use the interactive `mysql_secure_installation` utility:

    ```command
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    ```

    Provide the following responses to the questions in the script:

    -   For `Enter current password for root`, press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. Because the command is run using `sudo` privileges, a password is not required.
    -   For `Switch to unit_socket authentication`, answer <kbd>n</kbd>.
    -   For `Change the root password?`, answer <kbd>n</kbd>. It is safe to permit local `sudo` access with the standard `root` password.
    -   For `Remove anonymous users?`, answer <kbd>y</kbd>.
    -   For `Disallow root login remotely?`, answer <kbd>y</kbd>`.
    -   For `Remove test database and access to it?`, answer <kbd>y</kbd>.
    -   For `Reload privilege tables now?`, answer <kbd>y</kbd> to apply the changes.

1.  Access the database using `sudo`:

    ```command
    sudo mysql
    ```

    MariaDB displays background information about the application along with the `>` prompt:

    ```output
    Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MariaDB connection id is 9
    Server version: 10.5.21-MariaDB MariaDB Server

    Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    MariaDB [(none)]>
    ```

1.  Create the `webdata` database and a user account for web application access. In the `CREATE USER` query, provide a secure password in place of `EXAMPLE_PASSWORD` and a more meaningful username in place of `EXAMPLE_USERNAME`. Finally, grant full rights to the user.

    ```command
    CREATE DATABASE webdata;
    CREATE USER 'EXAMPLE_USERNAME' IDENTIFIED BY 'EXAMPLE_PASSWORD';
    GRANT ALL ON webdata.* TO 'EXAMPLE_USERNAME';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```

    MySQL should respond with `Query OK` after each line.

1.  Exit the SQL shell and return to the terminal prompt:

    ```command
    quit
    ```

### How to Install PHP

1.  Install the main PHP component, including the `php-mysqlnd` package for database integration:

    ```command
    sudo dnf install php php-common php-mysqlnd -y
    ```

1.  **Optional:** Install a selection of other commonly-used PHP extensions. Different applications might require additional PHP packages. Consult the application documentation for details.

    {{< tabs >}}
    {{< tab "Fedora" >}}
    ```command
    sudo dnf install php-cli php-gettext php-mbstring php-mcrypt php-pear php-curl php-gd php-xml php-bcmath php-zip php-json -y
    ```
    {{< /tab >}}
    {{< tab "AlmaLinux & Rocky Linux" >}}
    ```command
    sudo dnf install php-cli php-gettext php-mbstring php-pear php-curl php-gd php-xml php-bcmath php-zip php-json -y
    ```
    {{< /tab >}}
    {{< /tabs >}}

    {{< note >}}
    AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux do not support the `php-mcrypt` component. The omission of this package is the only difference from the Fedora version of the command above.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Verify the PHP release to confirm a successful installation:

    ```command
    php -v
    ```

    On Fedora, the current PHP release is `8.2.9`. AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux currently install release `8.0.27`.

    ```output
    PHP 8.2.9 (cli) (built: Aug  3 2023 11:39:08) (NTS gcc x86_64)
    Copyright (c) The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v4.2.9, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
        with Zend OPcache v8.2.9, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    To determine if a more recent release of PHP is available, use the command `dnf module list php`. To select a non-default release, use the command `dnf module enable php:RELEASE_NUMBER`. Substitute the desired release number for `RELEASE_NUMBER`.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Restart Apache to activate the PHP Apache API:

    ```command
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```

## How to Verify the LAMP Stack Installation

To verify the stack components, embed a PHP code block containing a database connection inside an HTML page. PHP code can be integrated into an HTML file using the `<?php` tag. The PHP code block can then connect to an SQL-based database using the `mysqli_connect` command. Provide the appropriate database credentials to connect.

To fully test all components of the LAMP stack, follow these steps.

1.  Change into the `var/www/html` directory and create a new `phptest.php` file:

    ```command
    cd /var/www/html
    sudo nano phptest.php
    ```

1.  Add the following contents to the file. Ensure the `servername` variable is set to `localhost`. Replace `EXAMPLE_USERNAME` and `EXAMPLE_PASSWORD` with the credentials for the database web user account.

    ```file {title="/var/www/html/phptest.php" lang="php" hl_lines="10-11"}
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>PHP Test</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <?php echo '<p>Welcome to the Site!</p>';

            // When running this script on a local database, the servername must be 'localhost'. Use the name and password of the web user account created earlier. Do not use the root password.
            $servername = "localhost";
            $username = "EXAMPLE_USERNAME";
            $password = "EXAMPLE_PASSWORD";

            // Create MySQL connection
            $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password);

            // If the conn variable is empty, the connection has failed. The output for the failure case includes the error message
            if (!$conn) {
                die('<p>Connection failed: </p>' . mysqli_connect_error());
            }
            echo '<p>Connected successfully</p>';
            ?>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

    When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Run the LAMP stack script test. Open a Web browser and navigate to either the IP address or the domain name followed by `/phptest.php`. For example, `http://example.com/phptest.php`, but replace `example.com` with your actual domain name or IP address.

1.  If the test is successful, the browser displays `connected successfully` message:

    ![Results of the PHP test](PHP-Test.png)

    {{< note >}}
    If the page displays the `Connection failed` message, verify the database credentials and try again. If an HTML error occurs, ensure the contents of the sample file are complete and correct. To isolate the PHP functionality, replace the contents between `<?php` and `?>`, with `phpinfo();`. This command displays information about the PHP installation and confirms if PHP is working.
    {{< /note >}}

## Additional LAMP Stack Production Considerations

The previous instructions are sufficient for small personal sites. However, commercial sites might require additional configuration. Here are some other issues to potentially consider.

1.  The database is not currently remotely accessible. To access MariaDB through the firewall, use the following commands:

    ```command
    sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=mysql --permanent
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

1.  To run multiple sites from the same server, configure a virtual host for each site. This is considered a more professional configuration even for a single site.

    To configure a virtual host, add a new directory at `/var/www/html/EXAMPLE_DOMAIN/public_html`. Replace `EXAMPLE_DOMAIN` with the actual domain name. Add the website files to this directory. Then edit the file at `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` to add the virtual hosts. Each virtual host must define a `DocumentRoot`, `ServerName`, and `ServerAdmin`.

    Consult the [Apache Virtual Host documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/) for more information.

1.  To remove the default welcome page, edit the file `/etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf` and comment out all directives using the `#` symbol.

## Conclusion

The Fedora LAMP stack consists of the Linux operating system, Apache web server, the MariaDB/MySQL database, and the PHP/Perl/Python programming language. Together, this architecture is suitable for most modern computing environments. All LAMP components are available in the standard Fedora package library and are installed using `dnf`. To test the stack, configure a database for the web user and create a simple script using HTML and PHP.
