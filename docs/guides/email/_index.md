Whether you're running a personal blog or an entire company's web infrastructure on your Linodes, these guides will assist you in getting a stable mail/groupware server up and running quickly. **Note:** These guides involve or result in sending email. In an effort to fight spam, Linode restricts outbound connections on ports 25, 465, and 587 on all Linodes for new accounts created after November 5th, 2019.
