In cloud computing, *failover* is the concept of rerouting traffic to a backup system should the original system become inaccessible. Linode Compute Instances support failover through the [IP Sharing](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#configuring-ip-sharing) feature. This allows two Compute Instances to share a single IP address, one serving as the *primary* and one serving as the *secondary*. If the primary Compute Instance becomes unavailable, the shared IP address is seamlessly routed to the secondary Compute Instance (fail*over*). Once the primary instance is back online, the IP address route is restored (fail*back*).

## Why Should I Implement Failover?

When hosting web-based services, the total uptime and availability of those services should be an important consideration. There’s always a possibility that your Compute Instance may become inaccessible, perhaps due to a spike in traffic, your own internal configuration issues, a natural disaster, or planned (or unplanned) maintenance. When this happens, any websites or services hosted on that instance would also stop working. Failover provides a mechanism for protecting your services against a single point of failure.

The term *high availability* describes web application architectures that eliminate single points of failover, offering redundancy, monitoring, and failover to minimize downtime for your users. Adding a load balancing solution to your application’s infrastructure is commonly a key component of high availability. Managed solutions, like Linode’s NodeBalancers, combine load balancing with built-in IP address failover. However, self-hosted solutions like nginx or haproxy do not include built-in IP failover. Should the system running the load balancing software experience downtime, the entire application goes down. To prevent this, you need an additional server running your load balancing software and a mechanism to failover the IP address. On the Linode platform, this is accomplished through the IP Sharing feature and some additional software configuration.

{{< note respectIndent=false >}}
For many production applications, you may want to consider a load balancing tool that goes beyond basic failover. Linode's [NodeBalancers](/docs/products/networking/nodebalancers/) combines load balancing with built-in failover. If you are using self-hosted load balancing software, such as NGINX or [HAProxy](/docs/guides/how-to-use-haproxy-for-load-balancing/), on your own Compute Instances, you must use the IP Sharing feature to provide failover for IP addresses.

## IP Sharing Availability

Within Linode's platform, failover is configured by first enabling [IP Sharing](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#configuring-ip-sharing) and then configuring software on both the primary and secondary Compute Instances. IP Sharing availability varies by data center. Review the list below to learn which data centers support IP Sharing and how it can be implemented.

| Data center | IP Sharing support | Failover method | Software | ID |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Atlanta (Georgia, USA) | *Not currently supported* | - | - | 4 |
| Dallas (Texas, USA) | *Undergoing network upgrades* | - | - | 2 |
| **Frankfurt (Germany)** | **Supported** | **BGP-based (new)** | [lelastic](/docs/guides/ip-failover/#configure-failover) / [FRR](/docs/guides/ip-failover-bgp-frr/) | 10 |
| Fremont (California, USA) | Supported | ARP-based (legacy) | [keepalived](/docs/guides/ip-failover-legacy-keepalived/) | 3 |

{{< note >}}
If a data center is marked as *undergoing network upgrades*, customers may encounter issues enabling IP Sharing and configuring failover. For Compute Instances that already have IP Sharing enabled, this feature should still function as intended. Once the network upgrades are completed, IP Sharing will be supported through the new method (BGP). Review documentation on our [planned network infrastructure upgrades](/docs/guides/network-infrastructure-upgrades/) to learn more about these changes.
{{< /note >}}

{{< note respectIndent=false >}}
IP failover for VLAN IP addresses is supported within every data center where VLANs are available. This feature does not depend on Linode's IP Sharing feature and depends on ARP-based failover software, such as keepalived.
{{< /note >}}

## IP Address Failover Methods

- **ARP-based (legacy method):** Supports IPv4. This method is currently being phased out. Since it is ARP-based, customers can configure it on their Compute Instances using software that supports VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol), such as keepalived. Follow the instructions within the [keepalived](/docs/guides/ip-failover-legacy-keepalived/) guide.

- **BGP-based (new method):** Supports IPv4 (public and private) and IPv6 routed ranges (/64 and /56). This is currently being rolled out across our fleet in conjunction with our [planned network infrastructure upgrades](/docs/guides/network-infrastructure-upgrades/). Since it is implemented using BGP routing, customers can configure it on their Compute Instances using lelastic (Linode’s own tool) or software like FRR, BIRD, or GoBGP.

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
While keepalived is not used directly for failover, you can still make use of `vrrp_scripts` for health checks. You might do so if you wish to retain some of your existing keepalived functionality when migrating to a BGP-based failover method.
{{< /note >}}

## Configure Failover

The instructions within this guide enable you to configure failover using IP Sharing and the [lelastic](https://github.com/linode/lelastic) tool, a Linode provided tool based on GoBGP that automates much of the configuration. While lelastic enables many basic implementations of failover, you may want to consider using FRR or any other BGP client if your implementation is more advanced. See [Configuring IP Failover over BPG using FRR](/docs/guides/ip-failover-bgp-frr/).

{{< note respectIndent=false >}}
If your data center supports the legacy method (ARP), use the [Configuring IP Failover using keepalived](/docs/guides/ip-failover-legacy-keepalived/) guide instead. That guide should also be used when setting up failover for VLAN IP addresses.
{{< /note >}}

To configure failover, complete each section in the order shown:

1. [Create and Share the Shared IP Address](#create-and-share-the-shared-ip-address)
1. For *each* Compute Instance:
    - [Add the Shared IP to the Networking Configuration](#add-the-shared-ip-to-the-networking-configuration)
    - [Install and Configure Lelastic](#install-and-configure-lelastic)
1. [Test Failover](#test-failover)

### Create and Share the Shared IP Address

1. Log in to the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/).

1. Determine which two Compute Instances are to be used within your failover setup. They both must be located in the same data center. If you need to, create those Compute Instances now and allow them to fully boot up.

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
To support this new BGP method of IP Sharing and failover, your Compute Instance must be assigned an IPv6 address. This is not an issue for most instances as an IPv6 address is assigned during deployment. If your Compute Instance was created *before* IPv6 addresses were automatically assigned, and you would like to enable IP Sharing within a data center that uses BGP-based failover, contact [Linode Support](https://www.linode.com/support/).
{{< /note >}}

1. Disable Network Helper on both instances. For instructions, see the [Network Helper](/docs/guides/network-helper/#individual-compute-instance-setting) guide.

1. Add an additional IPv4 address _or_ IPv6 range (/64 or /56) to one of the Compute Instances. See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#adding-an-ip-address) guide for instructions. Make a note of the newly assigned IP address. *Each additional IPv4 address costs $1 per month*.

1. On the *other* Compute Instance, add the newly assigned IPv4 address or IPv6 range as a *Shared IP* using Linode's **IP Sharing** feature. See [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#configuring-ip-sharing) for instructions on configuring IP sharing.

### Add the Shared IP to the Networking Configuration

Adjust the network configuration file on *each* Compute Instance, adding the shared IP address and restarting the service.

1. Log in to the Compute Instance using [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/guides/lish/).

1. Add the shared IP address to the system's networking configuration file. Within the instructions for your distribution below, open the designated file with a text editor (such as [nano](/docs/guides/use-nano-to-edit-files-in-linux/) or vim) and add the provided lines to the end of that file. When doing so, make the following replacements:

    - **[shared-ip]**: The IPv4 address you shared or an address from the IPv6 range that you shared. You can choose any address from the IPv6 range. For example, within the range *2001:db8:e001:1b8c::/64*, the address `2001:db8:e001:1b8c::1` can be used.
    - **[prefix]**: For an IPv4 address, use `32`. For an IPv6 address, use either `56` or `64` depending on the size of the range you are sharing.

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
Review the configuration file and verify that the shared IP address does not already appear. If it does, delete associated lines before continuing.
{{< /note >}}

    - **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and newer**: Using [netplan](https://netplan.io/). The entire configuration file is shown below, though you only need to copy the `lo:` directive.

        ```file {title="/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml" lang="yaml"}
        network:
          version: 2
          renderer: networkd
          ethernets:
            eth0:
              dhcp4: yes
            lo:
              match:
                name: lo
              addresses:
                - [shared-ip]/[prefix]
        ```

        To apply the changes, reboot the instance or run:

        ```command
        sudo netplan apply
        ```

    - **Debian and Ubuntu 16.04 (and older)**: Using [ifupdown](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/ifupdown/ifup.8.en.html). Replace *[protocol]* with `inet` for IPv4 or `inet6` for IPv6.

        ```file {title="/etc/network/interfaces"}
        ...
        # Add Shared IP Address
        iface lo [protocol] static
            address [shared-ip]/[prefix]
        ```

        To apply the changes, reboot the instance or run:

        ```command
        sudo ifdown lo && sudo ip addr flush lo && sudo ifup lo
        ```

        If you receive the following output, you can safely ignore it: *RTNETLINK answers: Cannot assign requested address*.

    - **CentOS/RHEL**: Using [NetworkManager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager). Since NetworkManager does not support managing the loopback interface, you need to first add a dummy interface named *shared* (or any other name that you wish). Instead of editing the file directly, the [nmcli](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nmcli) tool is used.

        ```command
        nmcli con add type dummy ifname shared
        ```

        Next, add your Shared IP address (or addresses) and bring up the new interface. Run the commands below, replacing *[protocol]* with `ipv4` for IPv4 or `ipv6` for IPv6 (in addition to replacing *[shared-ip]* and *[prefix]*)

        ```command
        nmcli con mod dummy-shared [protocol].method manual [protocol].addresses [shared-ip]/[prefix]
        nmcli con up dummy-shared
        ```

        Since the loopback interface is not used, you must also add the `-allifs` option to the lelastic command (discussed in a separate section below).

### Install and Configure Lelastic

Next, we need to configure the failover software on *each* Compute Instance. For this, the [lelastic](https://github.com/linode/lelastic) utility is used. For more control or for advanced use cases, follow the instructions within the [Configuring IP Failover over BPG using FRR](/docs/guides/ip-failover-bgp-frr/) guide instead of using lelastic.

1. Log in to the Compute Instance using [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/guides/lish/).

1. Install lelastic by downloading the latest release from the GitHub repository, extracting the contents of the archived file, and moving the lelastic executable to a folder within your PATH. This same process can be used to update lelastic, making sure to restart the lelastic service (detailed in a later step) to complete the upgrade. Before installing or updating lelastic, review the [releases page](https://github.com/linode/lelastic/releases) and update the version variable with the most recent version number.

    ```command
    version=v0.0.6
    curl -LO https://github.com/linode/lelastic/releases/download/$version/lelastic.gz
    gunzip lelastic.gz
    chmod 755 lelastic
    sudo mv lelastic /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
**CentOS/RHEL:** If running a distribution with SELinux enabled (such as most CentOS/RHEL distributions), you must also set the SELinux type of the file to `bin_t`.

```command
sudo chcon -t bin_t /usr/local/bin/lelastic
```
{{< /note >}}

1. Next, prepare the command to configure BGP routing through lelastic. Replace *[id]* with the ID corresponding to your data center in the [table above](/docs/guides/ip-failover/#ip-failover-support) and *[role]* with either `primary` or `secondary`. You do not need to run this command, as it is configured as a service in the following steps.

    ```command
    lelastic -dcid [id] -[role] &
    ```

    **Additional options:**
    - `-send56`: Advertises an IPv6 address as a /56 subnet (defaults to /64). This is needed when using an IP address from a IPv6 /56 routed range.
    - `-allifs`: Looks for the shared IP address on all interfaces, not just the loopback interface.

        {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
**CentOS/RHEL:** Since the Shared IP address is configured on the *eth0* interface for NetworkManager distributions (like CentOS/RHEL), you must add the `-allifs` option to the lelastic command.
{{< /note >}}

    See [Test Failover](#test-failover) to learn more about the expected behavior for each role.

1. Create and edit the service file using either nano or vim.

    ```command
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lelastic.service
    ```

1. Paste in the following contents and then save and close the file. Replace *$command* with the lelastic command you prepared in a previous step.

    ```file {title="etc/systemd/system/lelastic.service"}
    [Unit]
    Description= Lelastic
    After=network-online.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/$command
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

1. Apply the correct permissions to the service file.

    ```command
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/lelastic.service
    ```

1.  Start and enable the lelastic service.

    ```command
    sudo systemctl start lelastic
    sudo systemctl enable lelastic
    ```

    You can check the status of the service to make sure it's running (and to view any errors)

    ```command
    sudo systemctl status lelastic
    ```

    If you need to, you can stop and disable the service to stop failover functionality on the particular Compute Instance.

    ```command
    sudo systemctl stop lelastic
    sudo systemctl disable lelastic
    ```

## Test Failover

Once configured, the shared IP address is routed to the *primary* Compute Instance. If that instance becomes inaccessible, the shared IP address is automatically routed to the *secondary* instance (fail*over*). Once the primary instance is back online, the shared IP address is restored to that instance (fail*back*).

If desired, both instances can be configured with the same role (both primary or both secondary). This prevents failback functionality, meaning that the shared IP address is not restored to the original system, even if the original system comes back online.

You can test the failover functionality of the shared IP using the steps below.

1. Using a machine other than the two Compute Instances within the failover configuration (such as your local machine), ping the shared IP address.

    ```command
    ping [shared-ip]
    ```

    Review the output to verify that the ping is successful. The output should be similar to the following:

    ```output
    64 bytes from 192.0.2.1: icmp_seq=3310 ttl=64 time=0.373 ms
    ```

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
If you are sharing an IPv6 address, the machine from which you are running the `ping` command must have IPv6 connectivity. Not all ISPs have this functionality.
{{< /note >}}

1. Power off the *primary* Compute Instance or stop the lelastic service on that instance. Once the service has stopped or the instance has fully powered down, the shared IP address should be routed to the secondary instance.

    ```command
    sudo systemctl stop lelastic
    ```

1.  Verify that the shared IP is still accessible by again running the ping command. If the ping is successful, failover is working as intended.
