One step in securing a Linux computer system is identifying which ports are active. Your system's active ports give you information about which outside applications may be connected to your system. You can also discover if you are unintentionally exposing an application or service to the internet, like a MySQL database. There are several Linux tools that help you discover which ports are in use and identify both ends of active communications. This guide introduces three common tools you can use find the active ports on your Linux server or computer with links to guides that dive deeper into each tool.

## What is a Port in Computer Networking?

Service names and port numbers are used to distinguish between different services that run over transport protocols. Common transport protocols are TCP, UDP, DCCP, and SCTP. These protocols enable communication between applications by establishing a connection and ensuring data is transmitted successfully.  Well-known port assignments, such as HTTP at port 80 over TCP and UDP, are listed at the [IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml). These port assignments help distinguish different types of network traffic across the same connection.

## Which Linux System Ports Are in Use?

Three tools to help you check ports in use on a Linux system are:
- *netstat*: This tool shows your server's network status.
-  *ss*: You can view socket statistics with the ss tool. For example, ss allows you to monitor TCP, UDP, and UNIX sockets.
- *lsof*: This Linux utility lists open files. Since everything on a Linux system can be considered a file, lsof provides a lot of information on your entire system.

### Using netstat

This tool is great for inspecting the following areas of your Linux system:

- Unix sockets and network connections
- Routing tables
- Network interfaces
- Network protocols
- Multicast group membership

Running `netstat` without any options displays all open sockets and network connections, which can generate a *lot* of output. You can control the output using netstat's command-line options. For example, to view the PID and program name for a systemâ€™s listening TCP connections, run netstat with the following command-line options:

        netstat -ltp

The output resembles the following:

{{< output >}}
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:http-alt        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      381070/monitorix-ht

tcp        0      0 localhost:33060         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      9638/mysqld
tcp        0      0 localhost:mysql         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      9638/mysqld
tcp6       0      0 [::]:http               [::]:*                  LISTEN      10997/apache2
tcp6       0      0 [::]:ssh                [::]:*                  LISTEN      2145/sshd: /usr/sbi
{{</ output >}}

To learn how to install netstat, interpret its output, and view common command line options, see our [Inspecting Network Information with netstat](/docs/guides/inspecting-network-information-with-netstat/) guide.

### Using ss

The [**ss**](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/ss/) tool was created to improve upon netstat and provides more functionality. It allows you to monitor TCP, UDP, and UNIX sockets. A socket enables programs to communicate with each other across a network and is comprised of an IP address and a port number.

Running the `ss` with no options displays TCP, UDP, and UNIX sockets. Similar to netstat, restrict the ss command's output by using command-line options. For example, to view all listening and non-listening TCP sockets issue the following command:

        ss -t -a

The output resembles the following:

{{< output >}}
State         Recv-Q     Send-Q         Local Address:Port               Peer Address:Port     Process

To take a deeper dive into the ss tool, read our [Learning to Use the ss Tool to its Full Potential](/docs/guides/ss/) guide. This guide provides commands specific to each protocol, commands to view general statistics about a system's current connections, and ways to filter your output.

### Using lsof

Since everything on a Linux system can be considered a file, the **lsof** tool can report on many aspects of a system, including open network interfaces and network connections. The lsof tool is preinstalled on many Linux distributions, so you may consider using it before a tool you need to install. One unique feature of the lsof tool is *repeat mode**. This mode allows you to run the `lsof` command continuously on a timed interval. When inspecting your system to find information about which ports are in use, lsof can return information about which user and processes are using a specific port. For example, when working with a local development environment you may want to find which localhost ports are currently in use. Use the following command to retrieve this information:

        lsof -i@localhost

The output returns a similar response:

{{< output >}}
