RabbitMQ is an open source message broker that facilitates communication between distributed applications. This guide covers steps for manually installing, configuring, and testing RabbitMQ on a Linode instance running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

If you prefer an automated deployment, consider our [RabbitMQ Marketplace app](/docs/marketplace-docs/guides/rabbitmq/).

## Before You Begin

1.  If you do not already have a virtual machine to use, create a Compute Instance with at least 2 GB of memory running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. For resources and instructions on deploying an instance using Cloud Manager, see our [Get Started](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/getting-started) and [Create a Compute Instance](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/create-a-compute-instance) guides.

    {{< note title="Provisioning Compute Instances with the Linode CLI" type="secondary" isCollapsible="true" >}}
    Use these steps if you prefer to use the Linode CLI to provision resources.

    The following command creates a Linode 2 GB compute instance (`g6-standard-1`) running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (`linode/ubuntu24.04`) in the Miami datacenter (`us-mia`):

    ```command
    linode-cli linodes create \
      --image linode/ubuntu24.04 \
      --region us-mia \
      --type g6-standard-1 \
      --root_pass '{{< placeholder "PASSWORD" >}}' \
      --authorized_keys "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" \
      --label rabbitmq-linode
    ```

    Note the following key points:

    -   Replace `region` as desired.
    -   Replace {{< placeholder "PASSWORD" >}} with a secure alternative for your root password.
    -   This command assumes that an SSH public/private key pair exists, with the public key stored as `id_ed25519.pub` in the user’s `$HOME/.ssh` folder.
    -   The `--label` argument specifies the name of the new server (`rabbitmq-linode`).
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Follow our [Set Up and Secure a Compute Instance](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/set-up-and-secure-a-compute-instance) guide to update your system and create a limited user account. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, and harden SSH access.

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/guides/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## Install RabbitMQ as a Service

RabbitMQ offers an [installation script](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-debian#apt-quick-start-cloudsmith) for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. This script uses the latest versions of Erlang supported by RabbitMQ along with the latest version of the server itself.

1.  SSH into your instance as a user with `sudo` privileges:

    ```command
    ssh {{< placeholder "USERNAME" >}}@{{< placeholder "IP-ADDRESS" >}}
    ```

1.  Using a text editor such as `nano`, create a file called `install-rabbitmq.sh`:

    ```
    nano install-rabbitmq.sh
    ```

    Paste the code snippet for the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS installation script into the file:

    ```file {title="install-rabbitmq.sh"}
    #!/bin/sh

    sudo apt-get install curl gnupg apt-transport-https -y

    ```

    When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Run the script:

    ```command
    source ./install-rabbitmq.sh
    ```

1.  Your instance should now have the latest version of the RabbitMQ server running as a systemd service. Verify this with the following command:

    ```command
    systemctl status rabbitmq-server
    ```

    Output containing `active (running)` indicates that the service is enabled and running:

    ```output
    ● rabbitmq-server.service - RabbitMQ broker
         Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/rabbitmq-server.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
         Active: active (running) since Mon 2025-02-10 13:32:01 EST; 17min ago

            CPU: 3.317s
         CGroup: /system.slice/rabbitmq-server.service
    ```

1.  RabbitMQ supplies a client that allows direct access to the server when connecting from `localhost`. To further verify that the installation was successful and configured as desired, run the following:

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics status
    ```

    This prints a list of diagnostic information about the server such as CPU and memory usage, as well as locations of the logs and configuration files on the system.

    ```output

### Starting and Stopping RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ requires no additional configuration upon installation. While not required, configuration files can be stored in `/etc/rabbitmq`. See [RabbitMQ's official documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure) for more information on configuration options.

The RabbitMQ server can be controlled via systemd-managed services. For example:

-   Use `systemctl` to stop the RabbitMQ server:

    ```command
    systemctl stop rabbitmq-server
    ```

-   Use `systemctl` to start the RabbitMQ server:

    ```command
    systemctl start rabbitmq-server
    ```

-   Use `journalctl` to view the server logs:

    ```command
    journalctl -u rabbitmq-server
    ```

## Testing RabbitMQ

1.  To test the RabbitMQ deployment, first enable the RabbitMQ management plugin:

    ```command
    rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
    ```

    ```output
    Enabling plugins on node rabbit@rabbitmq-ubuntu-2404-1:
    rabbitmq_management
    The following plugins have been configured:
      rabbitmq_management
      rabbitmq_management_agent
      rabbitmq_web_dispatch
    Applying plugin configuration to rabbit@rabbitmq-ubuntu-2404-1...
    The following plugins have been enabled:
      rabbitmq_management
      rabbitmq_management_agent
      rabbitmq_web_dispatch

    started 3 plugins.
    ```

1.  Next, download the management script, which is available directly from `localhost` after enabling the plugin:

    ```command
    wget http://localhost:15672/cli/rabbitmqadmin
    ```

    ```output
    Resolving localhost (localhost)... ::1, 127.0.0.1
    Connecting to localhost (localhost)|::1|:15672... failed: Connection refused.
    Connecting to localhost (localhost)|127.0.0.1|:15672... connected.
    HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
    Length: 42630 (42K) [application/octet-stream]
    Saving to: ‘rabbitmqadmin’

    rabbitmqadmin       100%[===================>]  41.63K  --.-KB/s    in 0.002s

    2025-02-10 14:14:04 (24.9 MB/s) - ‘rabbitmqadmin’ saved [42630/42630]
    ```

1.  Make the script executable, and move it to a location included in the environment `PATH`:

    ```command
    chmod +x rabbitmqadmin
    sudo mv rabbitmqadmin /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### Create An Exchange and Queue

This guide demonstrates creating a [fanout exchange](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts#exchange-fanout), which "routes messages to all of the queues that are bound to it". A fanout closely resembles the pub/sub pattern and is typically used for broadcasting messages.

See RabbitMQ's official documentation for more on exchanges and queues: [RabbitMQ Tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials)

1.  Create a `fanout` style exchange on the RabbitMQ server with the following:

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqadmin declare exchange \
      name=test_fanout_exchange \
      type=fanout
    ```

    ```output
    exchange declared
    ```

1.  Create a queue to attach to this exchange to hold messages:

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqadmin declare queue \
      name=fanout_queue \
      durable=true
    ```

    ```output
    queue declared
    ```

1.  Bind the queue to the exchange:

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqadmin declare binding \
      source=test_fanout_exchange \
      destination=fanout_queue
    ```

    ```output
    binding declared
    ```

### Test Message Publishing and Retrieval

1.  Publish a message to the exchange (and bound queue):

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqadmin publish \
      exchange=test_fanout_exchange \
      routing_key=dummy_key \
      payload="Hello, world!"
    ```

    ```output
    Message published
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    The routing key is not necessary for a fanout exchange, as each message is routed to each queue regardless of the routing key. However, it is required for the `rabbitmqadmin` tool.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Retrieve the messages from the queue:

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqadmin get queue=fanout_queue
    ```

    ```output
    +-------------+----------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+------------------+------------+-------------+
    | routing_key |       exchange       | message_count |    payload    | payload_bytes | payload_encoding | properties | redelivered |
    +-------------+----------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+------------------+------------+-------------+
    | dummy_key   | test_fanout_exchange | 0             | Hello, world! | 13            | string           |            | False       |
    +-------------+----------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+------------------+------------+-------------+
    ```

## The RabbitMQ Web Interface

The RabbitMQ management plugin enables a web interface and API accessible at port `15672`. Assuming this port is not blocked by any firewall rules, you can access the web interface in your browser by visiting the following URL, replacing {{< placeholder "IP_ADDRESS" >}} with the IP of your Linode instance:

```command
http://{{< placeholder "IP_ADDRESS" >}}:15672
```

![Web browser accessing RabbitMQ management interface via port 15672 on a Linode Compute Instance.](rabbitmq-web-interface.png)

By default, RabbitMQ is initiated with a default [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts) and a [default administrative user](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#default-state) with username `guest` (and password `guest`). However, this user can only connect to the management interface from `localhost`. To connect to RabbitMQ remotely, a new user must be created.

### Create a New RabbitMQ Management User

1.  Use the `rabbitmqctl add_user` command and provide a username and password:

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqctl add_user "{{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_USERNAME" >}}" "{{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_PASSWORD" >}}"
    ```

    ```output
    Adding user "{{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_USERNAME" >}}" ...
    Done. Don't forget to grant the user permissions to some virtual hosts! See 'rabbitmqctl help set_permissions' to learn more.
    ```

1.  Add the `administrator` tag to the newly created user, giving them management privileges.

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags {{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_USERNAME" >}} administrator
    ```

    ```output
    Setting tags for user "{{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_USERNAME" >}}" to [administrator\] ...
    ```

### Set Permissions for the User on the Virtual Host

1.  Verify the name of the existing virtual host:

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqctl -q --formatter=pretty_table list_vhosts name description
    ```

    The default virtual host is named `/`:

    ```output
    ┌──────┬──────────────────────┐
    │ name │ description          │
    ├──────┼──────────────────────┤
    │ /    │ Default virtual host │
    └──────┴──────────────────────┘
    ```

1.  Grant permissions to the newly created user on this virtual host:

    ```command
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p "/" "{{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_USERNAME" >}}" ".*" ".*" ".*"
    ```

    ```output
    Setting permissions for user "{{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_USERNAME" >}}" in vhost "/" ...
    ```

### Access the RabbitMQ Management Interface Remotely

Return to the management console UI in a web browser, and log in with the credentials of the newly created user:

![RabbitMQ management interface login screen displaying username and password fields.](rabbitmq-login-screen.png)

After logging in, the **Overview** page displays metrics about the currently running RabbitMQ instance:

![RabbitMQ management dashboard overview displaying server metrics, queue status, and connection details.](rabbitmq-dashboard-overview.png)

### Send Test Requests to the RabbitMQ API

1.  Test publishing a message to an exchange using `curl` to send an authenticated request to the RabbitMQ API:

    ```command
    curl \
      -u {{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_USERNAME" >}}:{{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_PASSWORD" >}} \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -X POST \
      -d '{"properties":{},"routing_key":"dummy_key","payload":"Hello, curl!","payload_encoding":"string"}' \
      http://{{< placeholder "IP_ADDRESS" >}}:15672/api/exchanges/%2f/test_fanout_exchange/publish
    ```

    ```output
    {"routed":true}
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    The `%2f` in the request URL is the URL-encoded value for the name of the exchange (`/`).
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Now send an authenticated request to retrieve the last two messages from the queue:

    ```command
    curl \
      -u {{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_USERNAME" >}}:{{< placeholder "RABBITMQ_PASSWORD" >}} \
      -H "Content-type:application/json" \
      -X POST \
      -d '{"count":2,"ackmode":"ack_requeue_true","encoding":"auto"}' \
      http://{{< placeholder "IP_ADDRESS" >}}:15672/api/queues/%2f/fanout_queue/get | json_pp
    ```

    ```output
    [
       {
          "exchange" : "test_fanout_exchange",
          "message_count" : 1,
          "payload" : "Hello, world!",
          "payload_bytes" : 13,
          "payload_encoding" : "string",
          "properties" : [],
          "redelivered" : true,
          "routing_key" : "dummy_key"
       },
       {
          "exchange" : "test_fanout_exchange",
          "message_count" : 0,
          "payload" : "Hello, curl!",
          "payload_bytes" : 12,
          "payload_encoding" : "string",
          "properties" : [],
          "redelivered" : false,
          "routing_key" : "dummy_key"
       }
    ]
    ```
