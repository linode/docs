## What Is Rocket.Chat?

[Rocket.Chat](https://www.rocket.chat/) offers an open source communications platform with enterprise-grade features. Rocket.Chat combines a robust platform for communication and collaboration with a toolset for help desk and support operations.

At its core, Rocket.Chat is a platform for real-time communications with an emphasis on security. Rocket.Chat can manage conversations across your organization, similar to platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams. However, Rocket.Chat also supports federation, letting you communicate with other companies and your wider customer base.

It is Rocket.Chat's omnichannel features for integration and cross-channel communications that reach effectively into help desk and custom support use cases. When used in this way, you could also compare Rocket.Chat to services like Zendesk and Freshdesk.

## Why Choose Rocket.Chat Over Hosted SaaS Applications?

Rocket.Chat competes with tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, with one of the major differences being that Rocket.Chat can be self-hosted and the latter are software-as-a-service (SaaS).

What does this mean for you, and why would you choose Rocket.Chat over alternatives like Slack and Microsoft Teams?:

-   Rocket.Chat Community Edition is free and can be easily self-hosted. This provides both accessibility and a high degree of control around your collaboration platform.

-   Rocket.Chat prioritizes security, implementing some of the highest standards in the field. Rocket.Chat uses end-to-end encryption for communications and provides fine-grained, role-based permission control.

-   Rocket.Chat comes with omnichannel support, expanding the reach of your collaboration beyond the platform itself. For example, you can integrate a Rocket.Chat live chat pop-up on your website. You can also connect your workspace with other messaging services, like SMS, email, and WhatsApp to engage with external clients.

-   Rocket.Chat's omnichannel support also opens it up as an effective help desk. Using live chat integration and cross-channel messaging, you can integrate external customer support into the same platform you collaborate on internally.

-   Rocket.Chat is open source, so you can access the code and make the platform whatever you want. Moreover, open source software gets the benefits of community support and ongoing development.

## Choosing Between Rocket.Chat Community and Enterprise Editions

Rocket.Chat offers both a Community Edition and an Enterprise Edition. For this tutorial, the steps concern the Community Edition. However, you can upgrade the Community Edition to a self-hosted Enterprise Edition at any time.

So what ultimately sets the Community and Enterprise Editions apart, and why might you consider adopting Enterprise's premium features?:

-   **Support**: Rocket.Chat Enterprise includes access to Rocket.Chat's official support web portal, bringing professional assistance to managing your instance. Community is not without support, but it is from the open source community.

-   **Limitations**: Community instances are limited in both scaling and integration. For example, a Community instance can only make 10,000 push notifications per month, and only has access to five marketplace applications at a time.

-   **Channel Support**: Enterprise includes access to a wider range of channels by default. Those channels include services like WhatsApp Business and Twitter. Community only comes packaged with support for live chat, SMS, and email channels.

-   **Hosting Options**: Community supports self-hosting, which is what this tutorial demonstrates. However, with Enterprise you have access to Rocket.Chat's cloud-hosted deployment. That can be useful when getting started, though it does limit your control of the platform.

Along with these, the Enterprise Edition brings an array of other features and enhancements to Rocket.Chat's range of tools. You can learn more from the [Rocket.Chat Enterprise page](https://www.rocket.chat/enterprise).

## Deploy Rocket.Chat on Akamai Connected Cloud

When you are ready to deploy your own Rocket.Chat instance, you have several options to do so within Akamai Connected Cloud. Read on to see each and choose the approach that is best for your needs.

### Deploying via the One-Click App Marketplace

The quickest way to get started is to deploy Rocket.Chat through the One-Click App Marketplace. This approach does almost all of the work for you, from creating a fresh Compute Instance to installing and configuring all of the software.

Find the steps for the One-Click App Marketplace deployment in our guide on how to [Deploy Rocket.Chat through the Marketplace](/docs/products/tools/marketplace/guides/rocketchat/).

### Deploying to a Compute Instance

Rocket.Chat can be deployed manually to an Akamai Cloud Compute Instance. The process uses the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io) package manager, which bundles applications for Linux systems.

Follow the steps here to deploy Rocket.Chat to a fresh Compute Instance. The steps include not only the installation of Rocket.Chat, but also the configuration of a reverse proxy server with optional SSL certification.

#### Before You Begin

1.  If you have not already done so, create an Akamai account and Cloud Compute Instance. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/) and [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/) guides.

1.  Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/guides/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.
{{< /note >}}

#### Installing the Rocket.Chat Server

1.  Ensure that Snap is installed on your system. To find out if it is, and for installation steps for your system, refer to the [official Snap installation instructions](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).

1.  Install the Rocket.Chat package from Snapcraft:

    ```command
    sudo snap install rocketchat-server
    ```

Once the installation has finished, the Rocket.Chat server starts up, typically running by default on `localhost:3000`.

#### Setting Up a Reverse Proxy Server

You can access the Rocket.Chat instance right after installation, but it is usually better practice to set up a reverse proxy server for access. This lets you forward the default port to the HTTP and HTTPS ports to more easily and securely leverage a domain name.

Should you want SSL encryption for your instance, the reverse proxy also provides a basis for setting that up. The steps in the next section show how.

1.  Install NGINX to act as the reverse proxy server. You can install NGINX by following the appropriate section in our guide [Installing and Using NGINX](/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-use-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04/). Select your system's distribution from the drop down at the top of the page.

1.  Create the `sites-available` and `sites-enabled` directories in `/etc/nginx/` if they do not already exist:

    ```command
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/{sites-available,sites-enabled}
    ```

1.  Open the main NGINX configuration file located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` in a text editor like `nano`:

    ```command
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ```

1.  Ensure the file contains a line to include configurations from the `sites-enabled` directory: `include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;`. If not, add it directly below the `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;` line in the `http` section, like so:

    ```file {title="/etc/nginx/nginx.conf" lang="conf" hl_lines="5"}
    ...
    http {
        ...
        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
        ...
    }
    ```

1.  When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Create a new NGINX site configuration file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory. This tutorial names the file `rocketchat.conf`.

    ```command
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat.conf
    ```

1.  Give the file the contents shown below, but replace `example.com` with the domain name you actually intend to associate with the server, if any:

    ```file {title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat.conf" lang="conf" hl_lines="8"}
    upstream backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:3000;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        server_name example.com;

        error_log /var/log/nginx/rocketchat.access.log;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;

            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto http;
            proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;
            proxy_redirect http:// $scheme://;
        }
    }
    ```

1.  When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Enable the site configuration by creating a symbolic link in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory:

    ```command
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```

1.  Verify that the new NGINX configuration passes NGINX's tests:

    ```command
    sudo nginx -t
    ```

    ```output
    nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
    nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    If you are on a system that uses SELinux, such as CentOS, allow server network connections:

    ```command
    sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
    ```
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Restart the NGINX server once the configuration has been verified:

    ```command
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

#### Optional: Get an SSL Certificate

With a reverse proxy in place, you can easily enable SSL encryption for your Rocket.Chat instance using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). Enabling SSL encryption further secures the traffic on your server and works better with modern browsers.

1.  Install Certbot and use it to procure an SSL certificate for NGINX. Follow along with our guide [Use Certbot to Enable HTTPS with NGINX](/docs/guides/enabling-https-using-certbot-with-nginx-on-ubuntu/), selecting your system's distribution from the drop-down menu at the top of the page.

    {{< note >}}
    Completing these steps requires your system's public IP address to be associated with a domain name. The guide linked above includes a link with more information on this requirement.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Adjust the site's NGINX configuration in the `rocketchat.conf` file created earlier:

    ```command
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat.conf
    ```

1.  Certbot adds SSL configuration and a second server block. However, the Rocket.Chat server requires some different settings. Retain the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` values and second `server` section. In essence, replace the whole `server` block you added earlier with the modified version shown below. Be sure to replace the three instances of `example.com` with your actual domain name.

    ```file {title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat.conf" lang="conf" linenostart="5" hl_lines="2,9,10"}
    server {
        server_name example.com;

        listen 443 ssl;

        ssl on;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;

        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

        error_log /var/log/nginx/rocketchat.access.log;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;

            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
            proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;
            proxy_redirect off;
        }
    }
    ```

1.  When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Verify that the modified NGINX configuration passes NGINX's tests:

    ```command
    sudo nginx -t
    ```

    ```output
    nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
    nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
    ```

1.  Once verified, restart the NGINX server:

    ```command
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
### Deploying to a Kubernetes Cluster

For a more scalable solution, Rocket.Chat supports Kubernetes deployments. With a Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) cluster on Akamai Connected Cloud and using [Helm](https://helm.sh/), you can have a distributed Rocket.Chat instance running in only a few steps.

1.  Create an LKE cluster, and add its configuration to a local `kubectl` tool. All the steps for doing so are covered in our guide  [Linode Kubernetes Engine - Get Started](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/get-started/).

1.  Use the following `kubectl` command to view the LKE cluster's context name:

    ```command
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```

    ```output
    CURRENT   NAME            CLUSTER     AUTHINFO          NAMESPACE
    *         lke123456-ctx   lke123456   lke123456-admin   default
    ```

1.  Set kubectl to use the LKE cluster context, replacing `lke123456-ctx` below with the cluster's context name provided in the output from the command above:

    ```command
    kubectl config use-context lke123456-ctx
    ```

    ```output
    Switched to context "lke123456-ctx".
    ```

1.  Install Helm, a tool for installing applications onto Kubernetes clusters. Follow along with our guide on [Installing Apps on Kubernetes with Helm 3](/docs/guides/how-to-install-apps-on-kubernetes-with-helm-3/) for all the necessary steps.

1.  Add the Rocket.Chat chart to your Helm instance:

    ```command
    helm repo add rocketchat https://rocketchat.github.io/helm-charts
    ```

1.  Create a Helm chart configuration file (e.g. `rocketchat-values.yaml`) for the Rocket.Chat deployment:

    ```command
    nano rocketchat-values.yaml
    ```

1.  The example below provides the minimum necessary settings. You can reference the full range of options in the [official documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat/deploy/prepare-for-your-deployment/rapid-deployment-methods/helm#configuration). Replace the passwords here with actual passwords you intend to use to secure Rocket.Chat's database:

    ```file {title="rocketchat-values.yaml" lang="yaml" hl_lines="4,5"}
    mongodb:
      auth:
        passwords:
          - rocketchatpass
        rootPassword: rocketchatrootpass
    ```

1.  When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Deploy the Helm chart for Rocket.Chat. The command here assumes you named the Helm chart configuration `rocketchat-values.yaml`.

    ```command
    helm install rocketchat -f rocketchat-values.yaml rocketchat/rocketchat
    ```

#### Forwarding to the Rocket.Chat Cluster

You have a few options to access the Rocket.Chat instance from the Kubernetes cluster. Below you can see two useful options for getting started:

-   **Port Forwarding**: This option on its own is only viable for testing. It uses `kubectl` to forward the Kubernetes service to a local port.

    ```command
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=rocketchat,app.kubernetes.io/instance=rocketchat" -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') 8888:3000
    ```

    After the command above, you are able to access the Rocket.Chat instance on `localhost:8888`. You could then set up a reverse proxy, as shown further above, but the next option is preferable for production usage.

-   **Ingress Deployment**: NGINX Ingress can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster to provide routing. In this way, it can act as a kind of reverse proxy on the Kubernetes cluster.

    For more on this method, and steps for implementing it, follow our guide on [Deploying NGINX Ingress on Linode Kubernetes Engine](/docs/guides/deploy-nginx-ingress-on-lke/#install-the-nginx-ingress-controller), starting with the *Install the NGINX Ingress Controller* section.

    To enable TLS for the Ingress, follow [Getting Started with Load Balancing on an LKE Cluster](/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/load-balancing/#configuring-linode-nodebalancers-for-tls-encryption), starting with the *Configuring NodeBalancers for TLS Encryption* section.

## Access Rocket.Chat After Deployment

With your own Rocket.Chat instance up and running, you can now access the workspace and begin setting it up to meet your needs. These next sections show you how to start using your instance, from completing the setup, to navigating the interface, to using the mobile application.

### Completing the Rocket.Chat Setup

On first accessing your instance, you are prompted to complete the setup. That means creating an administrator user, entering some information about your organization, and registering your instance.

1.  Open a Web browser and navigate to the Rocket.Chat instance's address. For example, assuming your domain name is `example.com` and that you set up SSL, your address would be `https://example.com`.

1.  Follow along with the prompts to complete your instance setup. Keep track of the credentials you use to create the administrator user. When prompted, enter your email, and use the provided code to verify the email address.

    ![Rocket.Chat initial set up prompt](rocketchat-initial-set-up.png)

1.  You may see a warning indicating that the site is configured for `localhost:3000` but has been visited via another domain. Accept the proposed configuration change.

Afterward, you are taken to the dashboard for your Rocket.Chat workspace.

### Overview of the Rocket.Chat Web Interface

Each time you log in after the initial setup, you should see the dashboard for your Rocket.Chat workspace. The left pane shows the workspace channels, where workspace users can start collaborating. The middle provides quick access for administrator tools.

[![Rocket.Chat dashboard](rocketchat-dashboard_small.png)](rocketchat-dashboard.png)

In addition to these quick tools, administrator users have access to the **Administration** menu. Access this from the top of the left pane, using the three dots.

From there, navigate to the **Workspace** option, and select **Settings** from the next menu. The resulting **Settings** menu provides a wide range of options for customizing and fine-tuning your workspace.

![Rocket.Chat settings page](rocketchat-settings.png)

Further into the tutorial are some ideas for making the workspace your own.

### Accessing Rocket.Chat via Mobile App

Rocket.Chat has an official mobile application for both iOS and Android devices. With the workspace address and provisioned user account, your users can converse and collaborate from the convenience of their phones.

Learn more about the Rocket.Chat mobile application and how to use it in the [official documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/rocket.chat-mobile).

For now, here are the general steps for getting started on a mobile device.

1.  Download the Rocket.Chat application to the mobile device. You can get the application from the Apple App Store or Google Play.

1.  Open the application, and, when prompted, enter your Rocket.Chat instance's domain as the workspace (e.g. `example.com`).

1.  Use your Rocket.Chat user credentials to log in when prompted, just as you would in the web browser.

## Configure Rocket.Chat as a Business Communication and Collaboration Tool

Your Rocket.Chat workspace is now ready for all the communication and collaboration you would expect. Use the existing *#general* channel, or create a channel of your own, and start talking.

Beyond that, here are some additional things you can do to give your Rocket.Chat workspace a stronger foundation for effective and engaging collaboration.

### Customize the Workspace

Make your Rocket.Chat workspace stand out as your own by adding organizational branding and styling. Within the Rocket.Chat documentation, this process is known as *white-labeling*.

Most of these customizations are handled from the **Layout** page, which you can reach from your Rocket.Chat dashboard using one of these methods:

-   Click the **Customize** button in the upper right of the **Home** page.

-   Access **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **Layout** starting from the three dots at the top of the channel pane.

For more on customizing your workspace, see the [Basic White-labeling](https://docs.rocket.chat/setup-and-configure/accessing-your-workspace/basic-white-labeling) page within Rocket.Chat's official documentation.

### Inviting Users

The Rocket.Chat workspace needs users to start conversations. Use either the **Administration** menu or the **Add User** button on the dashboard to access the **Users** page, where you can add and manage users.

From there, you have two options for adding new users:

-   **Invitations**: Use the **Invite** button, and enter the email addresses for prospective users. But first you need to have SMTP functions enabled on your instance. Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/email/email-configuration) for the appropriate steps.

    {{< content "email-warning-shortguide" >}}

-   **Manual Entry**: Use the **New** button, and enter the details of a new user you want to create. The form includes a **Require password change** option that can be useful for forcing new users to change temporary passwords when they first log in.

Find out more about user-related administration in Rocket.Chat from the [official documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users).

## Configure Rocket.Chat as a Customer Service Help Desk Platform

One of Rocket.Chat's advantages over other collaboration solutions is its ability to also operate as a customer support and help desk platform. With Rocket.Chat's omnichannel feature, your workspace opens up to the wider world. This allows you to communicate with other companies and your customers.

Using Rocket.Chat's omnichannel support, you can connect your workspace to your other media and other communication platforms. For instance, embed a Rocket.Chat live chat pop-up for customer support on your website. You could also enable SMS communications to support clients via text messaging.

### Enabling Omnichannel in Rocket.Chat

1.  Access the **Settings** page, via **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings**, and open the **Omnichannel** option.

1.  Ensure that **Omnichannel enabled** is toggled on, and save the changes.

### Managing Omnichannel Features in Rocket.Chat

Once Omnichannel has been enabled, you can manage your instance's omnichannel setup from within the same omnichannel settings page. It is located at **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **Omnichannel**.

To learn more about how to configure your workspace's omnichannel support for your needs, look through the [official documentation for omnichannel support](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/omnichannel).

To get started, here are a couple of Rocket.Chat's omnichannel features you may want to set up first:

-   **SMS Communications**: Rocket.Chat uses Twilio integration to allow external users to communicate with your workspace. Follow along with the [official documentation for SMS](https://docs.rocket.chat/extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/sms) to get everything you need.

-   **Email Messaging**: Omnichannel also supports email communications, allowing you to field and manage client emails through your Rocket.Chat workspace. The official documentation has both an Omnichannel administrator guide for [setting up an Email Inbox](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/email-inboxes) and an Omnichannel agent guide for [using Email Inboxes](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/omnichannel-agents-guides/email-inboxes).

## Conclusion

Rocket.Chat is a popular open source communications and collaboration platform. Installation is extremely simple via the One-Click App Marketplace. Manual setup on an Akamai Cloud Compute Instance or deployment via the Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) are also pretty straightforward.

Once setup, the graphical user interfaces contains all the settings admins need to manage workspaces, users, and more. You should also have some ideas for how to utilize Rocket.Chat as a capable chat and help desk tool.
