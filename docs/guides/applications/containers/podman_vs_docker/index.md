[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a free open source *container management* application. It is a solid alternative to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and works very similarly. This guide introduces Podman and compares Docker vs Podman. It also explains some of Podman's advantages and lists some of the situations where it is the best option.

## An Introduction to Containers and Container Management

A container is more like a software package than an actual application. It is a virtualized computing environment that runs at the operating system level. Containers manage all dependencies and ensure all necessary components are included. A container typically consists of software code, supporting applications, tools, libraries, and configuration settings. Each container includes a *container runtime*, which is responsible for mounting the container and interacting with the operating system to launch it. There are a considerable number of ready-made containers available through public registries, but developers can build their own containers to fit their own needs.

Here are some of the advantages of containers compared to a traditional server environment.

- Containers ensure each runtime environment is configured the same way, with the same applications, configuration, and environment. This maintains consistency throughout an organization. Containers are particularly useful in distributed environments where the load is shared between servers.
- Containers are quick to deploy and easy to scale. Administrators can instantiate a container using only a few commands, rather than spending a considerable amount of time installing and configuring each element.
- Containers are lightweight and portable across platforms because they are separate from the operating system details.
- Containers are often more secure than a suite of stand-alone applications.
- Version management and other maintenance tasks are simplified. The version of each application can be held consistent across servers and the software packages can be updated at the same time.
- A standardized container architecture facilitates testing, operations, and maintenance. It reduces the chance of configuration errors and missing dependencies. Container installation and maintenance can be easily automated.

Containers can be managed using container orchestration management software. These management applications help users package software, third-party applications, libraries, supporting tools, and configuration settings into a stand-alone package. The resulting package is sometimes referred to as an image, but it is not a software image in the traditional sense of the word. It is more like a software repository. Container orchestration software can also modify, update, deploy, and run the containers.

## What is Podman?

Podman is an open source container orchestration tool that is available for most major Linux distributions. Podman is used to build, manage, share, deploy, and run containers. It also allows users to pull, modify, and tag their container images. Podman is similar in some ways to Kubernetes in terms of its architecture and design philosophy. Red Hat originally developed Podman as an alternative to Docker.

Podman also offers a RESTful API to manage containers remotely. A remote Podman client is available for the Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. However, only Linux servers can run the RESTful service.

Podman follows standards set by the [*Open Container Initiative*](https://opencontainers.org/) (OCI), a governance organization tasked with defining open standards for container formats and runtimes. OCI offers a *Runtime Specification* and an *Image Specification*, along with the `runC` container runtime for implementing the OCI specifications. The OCI standards enable cross-vendor management of containers and allow the same containers to run on different platforms. This means Podman containers operate like containers from other container management systems. Podman is fully interoperable with Docker and other OCI-compliant container systems. Users can switch back and forth between container managers as required.

Podman uses an OCI-compliant *Container Runtime* to interact with the operating system and create containers. In addition to containers, Podman manages container images, container volumes, and Pods. It also includes the powerful `libpod` library.

A Pod allows users to administer two or more containers as a single organizational unit. All containers inside a Pod can be started, stopped, or deleted at the same time. Pods are more efficient than separate containers. They allow developers to share resources across different containers and better organize the container components. Each layer of a solution can be separated into its own Pod. For instance, one container might include a web server while another contains the database and the relevant data. Kubernetes uses a similar Pod concept. This makes the two technologies easier to integrate.

Whereas Docker is a comprehensive full-service containerization solution, Podman specializes in managing Pods and container images. Podman uses technology borrowed from [Buildah](https://buildah.io/) to build containers. It also collaborates with `runc` and a container image inspection service. Podman does not use a daemon. It launches Pods and containers as child processes. Users operate Podman using a command line interface.

For more background about Podman, see the Podman [overview](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/) and [introduction](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Introduction.html).

{{< note >}}
Podman incorporates some functionality from Buildah, so it does not have to use Buildah to build container images. However, many Podman users build containers using Buildah due to its advanced build capabilities and incorporate Buildah features into their custom shell scripts.

## Podman vs Docker

Podman and Docker overlap in many ways, but there are two major differences between the two applications. Podman supports Pods and does not use a daemon, while Docker uses a daemon and does not support Pods. Despite their differences, the two applications produce interoperable images. But Docker is definitely the incumbent product in this space.

Podman is much more focussed than Docker. Docker is an all-in-one general purpose tool, while Podman focuses its attention on Pod and container management. The subsequent sections feature a more in-depth discussion of the Docker vs Podman debate.

### Similarities Between Podman and Docker

Podman and Docker are similar applications with the same purpose. Both are used for container orchestration. They can both create, build, manage, and run containers. Here are some of the other similarities between Docker and Podman.

- **Registry Access**: Both applications can store images in a registry or pull images from a registry.
- **Project Creation**: Both tools are able to create a project from scratch without any helper software.
- **Syntax**: The two applications share much of the same syntax. In fact, the core commands are exactly the same. For example, `docker pull` and `podman pull` both do the same thing. Podman accepts and understands most native Docker commands. This means Podman can run Docker scripts. In most cases, users can even alias the `docker` command to `podman`.
- **Interoperation**: Podman and Docker container images are interoperable. Podman can run Docker container images, while Docker can run containers built by Podman.
- **Complexity**: Both applications have a fairly steep learning curve and require solid Linux experience.

### Differences Between Podman and Docker

Podman and Docker are also quite different in terms of their design and features. Here are some of the main differences between Podman vs Docker.

- **Specialization**: Podman is a highly-specialized tool. It focuses on container creation, deployment, and management, and uses complementary tools like Buildah when necessary. Docker is a self-contained and comprehensive solution for general usage. Docker contains add-ons including Docker Swarm, for managing a cluster of containers. It incorporates tools for performing tasks such as network configuration and traffic management.
- **Pods**: Podman offers Pods, which can contain multiple containers. Docker does not have this feature. Pod definitions can be exported from Podman to a YAML manifest that other applications can use. Docker includes the Docker Compose utility, but it requires users to create their own YAML files and is not as efficient, powerful, or useful.
- **Dameon Usage**: Podman does not use a daemon. Users interact directly with the main Podman application. The main Podman process is the parent of all Pods and containers. Podman allows users to run and manage their own containers using `systemd`. By comparison, Docker uses a daemon, which accepts commands from the CLI. It runs in the background and manages the various containers and container images. In this sense, Docker has a typical client-server architecture.
- **Root Access**: Podman permits users to run their own Pods and containers without using `sudo`. Because it uses a daemon, Docker requires root access.
- **Build Tools**: The Podman build capabilities are fairly rudimentary. Many developers opt to use the Buildah tools instead. Docker includes an all-purpose build system for constructing containers without outside assistance.
- **Swarm**: Although Podman supports most Docker functionality, it does not support Docker Swarm or any Swarm commands.
- **Tool Maturity**: Docker is the more established tool, with a larger user base, more comprehensive documentation, and more polished materials. Podman is a much newer product. It is less mature than Docker and is still adding features.

## Why Use Podman Over Docker?

After accounting for all the differences between Podman and Docker, there are several reasons to use Podman. In some situations, Podman makes more sense. The similarities between the syntax allows users to move from Docker to Podman with very little difficulty. Here are some of the main reasons to use Podman.

- **Pods**: Podman Pods group multiple containers into a single unit. They are very efficient and help simplify and organize development. An entire Pod can be implemented and controlled independently.
- **Kubernetes**: Podman works especially well with Kubernetes and is a good choice for Kubernetes management. Both applications share a similar Pod-based organizational structure. Some Podman features are designed for Kubernetes management. Kubernetes can process Podman manifest files, which are written in YAML.
- **Simplicity**: Podman is simpler and easier to use. For a more comprehensive solution, other tools can be used alongside Podman. Docker is perhaps too complicated for many use cases and does not integrate as well with other tools.
- **Security**: Podman is considered more secure because it does not require root privileges. System users can run Pods and containers without using `sudo`. This makes Podman more difficult to attack. Docker uses daemons, which require root privileges. This leaves Docker more vulnerable to interference.
- **Multi-User Design**: Each user manages their own set of containers and images and stores them in their own home directory. This means multiple users can run Podman on the same host without interference.
- **Efficiency**: While the difference in Podman and Docker performance is not huge, Podman is more efficient. It uses less memory and works more quickly than Docker does. Some analysts believe Podman has a more reliable design. Docker has more points of failure, and a crash can result in orphaned processes.
- **Interoperability**: Podman is interoperable with Docker. Both applications can be used together in the same project. The Podman CLI accepts most Docker commands.
- **Integration**: It is easy to transition to Podman from another container management system. Many developers use Docker during the design phase, and then move operations to Podman for the general availability release. This takes advantage of the more generous toolset from Docker and the ease-of-use and better security of Podman.

## Conclusion

Podman is an open source container management application that is a viable alternative to Docker. Podman can create, manage, deploy, and run containers, which are a virtualized computing environment. When comparing Podman vs. Docker, Podman concentrates more on container creation, deployment, and management. Docker is a more comprehensive tool with more features.

Podman allows users to create Pods, which can manage multiple containers as a single unit. It is also highly efficient and easy to use. Because it does not use a daemon and does not require root access it is considered more secure. Podman inter-operates with Docker and can even run Docker commands, making it easy to integrate into a project. For more information about Podman, see the [Podman site](https://podman.io/).
