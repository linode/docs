![Find files in Linux using the command line](find-files-linux-command-line-title.jpg "Find Files in Linux using the command line")

When you have to find a file in Linux, it's sometimes not as easy as finding a file in another operating system. This is especially true if you are running Linux without a graphical user interface and need to rely on the command line. This article covers the basics of how to find a file in Linux using the CLI. The `find` command in Linux is used to find a file (or files) by recursively filtering objects in the file system based on a simple conditional mechanism. You can use the `find` command to search for a file or directory on your file system. By using the `-exec` flag (`find -exec`), files can be found and immediately [processed within the same command](#how-to-find-and-process-a-file-in-linux).

## Find a File in Linux by Name or Extension
Use `find` from the command line to locate a specific file by name or extension.
The following example searches for `*.err` files in the `/home/username/` directory and all sub-directories:

    find /home/username/ -name "*.err"

## Using Common `find` Commands and Syntax to Find a File in Linux

`find` expressions take the following form:

    find options starting/path expression

* The `options` attribute will control the `find` process's behavior and optimization method.
* The `starting/path` attribute will define the top-level directory where `find` begins filtering.
* The `expression` attribute controls the tests that search the directory hierarchy to produce output.

Consider the following example command:

    find -O3 -L /var/www/ -name "*.html"

This command enables the maximum optimization level (-O3) and allows `find` to follow symbolic links (`-L`). `find` searches the entire directory tree beneath `/var/www/` for files that end with `.html`.

### Basic Examples

| Command                                              | Description                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `find . -name testfile.txt`                          | Find a file called testfile.txt in current and sub-directories.                  |
| `find /home -name *.jpg`                            | Find all `.jpg` files in the `/home` and sub-directories.                        |
| `find . -type f -empty`                              | Find an empty file within the current directory.                                 |
| `find /home -user exampleuser -mtime -7 -iname ".db"` | Find all `.db` files (ignoring text case) modified in the last 7 days by a user named exampleuser.  |

## Options and Optimization for `find`

The default configuration for `find` will ignore symbolic links (shortcut files). If you want `find` to follow and return symbolic links, you can add the `-L` option to the command, as shown in the example above.

`find` optimizes its filtering strategy to increase performance. Three user-selectable optimization levels are specified as `-O1`, `-O2`, and `-O3`. The `-O1` optimization is the default and forces `find` to filter based on filename before running all other tests.

Optimization at the `-O2` level prioritizes file name filters, as in `-O1`, and then runs all file-type filtering before proceeding with other more resource-intensive conditions. Level `-O3` optimization allows `find` to perform the most severe optimization and reorders all tests based on their relative expense and the likelihood of their success.

| Command     | Description                                                                                               |
|------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-O1`       | (Default) filter based on file name first.                                                                 |
| `-O2`       | File name first, then file type.                                                                           |
| `-O3`       | Allow `find` to automatically re-order the search based on efficient use of resources and likelihood of success. |
| `-maxdepth X` | Search current directory as well as all sub-directories X levels deep.                                   |
| `-iname`    | Search without regard for text case.                                                                       |
| `-not`      | Return only results that do not match the test case.                                                       |
| `-type f`   | Search for files.                                                                                          |
| `-type d`   | Search for directories.                                                                                    |

## Find a File in Linux by Modification Time

The `find` command contains the ability to filter a directory hierarchy based on when the file was last modified:

    find / -name "*conf" -mtime -7
    find /home/exampleuser/ -name "*conf" -mtime -3

The first command returns a list of all files in the entire file system that end with the characters `conf` and modified in the last seven days. The second command filters `exampleuser` user's home directory for files with names that end with the characters `conf` and modified in the previous three days.

## Use `grep` to Find a File in Linux Based on Content

The `find` command can only filter the directory hierarchy based on a file's name and metadata. If you need to search based on the file's content, use a tool like [`grep`](/docs/tools-reference/search-and-filter-text-with-grep). Consider the following example:

    find . -type f -exec grep "example" '{}' \; -print

This searches every object in the current directory hierarchy (`.`) that is a file (`-type f`) and then runs the command `grep "example"` for every file that satisfies the conditions. The files that match are printed on the screen (`-print`). The curly braces (`{}`) are a placeholder for the `find` match results. The `{}` are enclosed in single quotes (`'`) to avoid handing `grep` a malformed file name. The `-exec` command is terminated with a semicolon (`;`), which should be escaped (`\;`) to avoid interpretation by the shell.

## How to Find and Process a File in Linux

The `-exec` option runs commands against every object that matches the find expression. Consider the following example:

    find . -name "rc.conf" -exec chmod o+r '{}' \;

This filters every object in the current hierarchy (`.`) for files named `rc.conf` and runs the `chmod o+r` command to modify the `find` results' file permissions.

The commands run with the `-exec` are executed in the `find` process's root directory. Use `-execdir` to perform the specified command in the directory where the match resides. This may alleviate security concerns and produce a more desirable performance for some operations.

The `-exec` or `-execdir` options run without further prompts. If you prefer to be prompted before action is taken, replace `-exec` with `-ok` or `-execdir` with `-okdir`.

## How to Find and Delete a File in Linux

{{< caution >}}
Be very careful using this.
{{< /caution >}}

To delete the files that end up matching your search, you can add `-delete` at the end of the expression. Do this only when you are positive the results will only match the files you wish to delete.

In the following example, `find` locates all files in the hierarchy starting at the current directory and fully recursing into the directory tree. In this example, `find` will delete all files that end with the characters `.err`:

    find . -name "*.bak" -delete
