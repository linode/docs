Apache's JMeter offers a robust and portable open-source solution for load testing. JMeter can measure the performance of your web applications and give you insights about the kinds of loads your applications can handle.

Through this tutorial, learn more about load testing and how to get started using JMeter to load test your web applications.

## Before You Begin

1. If you have not already done so, create a Linode account and Compute Instance. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/) and [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/) guides.

1. Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/guides/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## What Is Load Testing?

*Load testing* is a type of performance testing used specifically to ensure that web applications perform effectively under projected usage loads. Load tests help you anticipate your applications' performance and resource needs so that you can use the best solutions for uninterrupted user experiences.

Most often load tests use test plans to model normal and peak traffic and typical user behavior. From there, the load test should give you metrics on response times, resource usage, and more.

The data you get from load tests can go a long way. You can learn whether your infrastructure is enough to handle your expected traffic, or whether you have more resources than you actually need.

Using load testing to fine tune your infrastructure and allocated resources can both ensure more consistent user experiences and save you money.

## Why Use JMeter?

[Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/index.html) is an open-source load testing tool built entirely in Java. JMeter gives you a robust option for measuring and analyzing your web applications' performance under various loads.

JMeter has both the advantage of being open source, and thus easier to get started with, as well as being widely and popularly used. JMeter thus is accessible and price efficient while having the community support that comes with popular open-source solutions.

## How to Install JMeter

JMeter should be installed on a machine from which you want to run tests, not necessarily the machine running the application you want to test. Additionally, JMeter strongly prefers use of its GUI to create test plans, so you should have GUI access for whatever system it is installed on.

1. Install Java. For JMeter, you need to have a Java version 8 or higher. You can use one of the following methods to install Java for your system.

    - Oracle provides [installation documentation](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) for installing its version of Java on a variety of systems. You can download the corresponding installation files through Oracle's [Java downloads](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) page.

    - You may, alternatively, opt to install the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/), an open-source alternative to Oracle's JDK that can operate fully in place of it. Follow the instructions on the [OpenJDK installation](https://openjdk.org/install/) page to install OpenJDK on your system.

        Additionally, on macOS, you can install the OpenJDK conveniently through the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager, using the [openjdk](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openjdk) formula.

1. Download the JMeter binaries package. You can do so on the [Apache JMeter download page](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi).

    This tutorial uses the zip file with the binaries for JMeter `5.5`. Be sure to replace the naming throughout this guide with the name appropriate to the version of JMeter you download.

    Should you want to verify the download, use the link for the SHA512 corresponding to your download. Then follow the commands in the [Checking Hashes](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html#CheckingHashes) section of Apache's documentation on verifying Apache software.

1. Extract the downloaded package to a directory you want your JMeter instance installed to. Then locate the JMeter executable for your system within the `bin/` subdirectory of the extracted directory.

    - On Linux and Mac, the executable is `jmeter`

    - On Windows, the executable is `jmeter.bat`

Now, use your system's command line to run the executable file for JMeter, and you should see the JMeter GUI start up. The example commands below to start up JMeter assume you installed version 5.5 within the current user's home directory.

- On Linux and Mac, start the executable with a command like this

    ```command
    ~/apache-jmeter-5.5/bin/jmeter
    ```

- On Windows, start the executable with a command like this, replacing `example-user` with your actual username

    ```command
    C:\Users\example-user\apache-jmeter-5.5\bin\jmeter.bat
    ```

{{< note >}}
For Linux and Mac, you can follow our guide on how to [Add a Directory to the PATH on Linux](/docs/guides/how-to-add-directory-to-path/). Add the `bin/` directory to your shell path, and you are able to start up JMeter readily from the command line simply with the `jmeter` command.

## How to Start Load Testing with JMeter

Now you can start using JMeter to load test your web application. JMeter's GUI provides a set of tools for building your test plan, including recording browser actions for modeling user behavior. Then you can execute the plan using JMeter's CLI and see how your applications respond.

To help you get started, this tutorial also includes steps for creating a simple web application to run JMeter against. This lets you get a clear picture of how JMeter works before you start using it on your own applications.

### Preparing an Example Application

To create a base web application to try out JMeter on, you can follow the steps here on an application server. These steps specifically assume a Linode Compute Instance server. The instructions should work whether your system is running Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, or most other distributions.

1. Follow our guide on how to [Install and Use the Node Package Manager (NPM) on Linux](/docs/guides/install-and-use-npm-on-linux/). NPM handles the installation of the application framework and its dependencies as well as running the example application itself.

1. Next.js can create a base web application with only a few commands, so it works well for this example. Use the commands here to create a base Next.js project named `example-app` using the `create-next-app` executor. These commands put the application in the current user's home directory and then change into the new application directory.

    ```command
    cd ~/
    npx create-next-app example-app
    cd example-app/
    ```

    Answer the prompts as you would like or you can answer all with the default values. Though you should answer `No` to the using the `app/` directory.

    You can learn more about building web applications with Next.js in our guide [Getting Started with Next.js](/docs/guides/getting-started-next-js/).

1. Open port `3000` on your system's firewall. This is the default port for the example Next.js application, and the port needs to be open for your browser and JMeter to access the application.

    - For **Debian** and **Ubuntu**, refer to our guide on [How to Configure a Firewall with UFW](/docs/guides/configure-firewall-with-ufw/).

    - For **CentOS**, **Fedora**, and similar distributions, refer to our guide on [Enabling and Configuring FirewallD on CentOS](/docs/guides/introduction-to-firewalld-on-centos/)

1. Start up the Next.js application. This runs the included "Welcome" application on a development server, which should not be used for production applications but should work fine to demonstrate JMeter's capabilities.

    ```command
    npm run dev
    ```

To verify that you example application is running, in a web browser navigate to port `3000` on your system's public address. So, if your system's public IP address is `192.0.2.0`, that would mean going to `http://192.0.2.0:3000`.

### Creating a JMeter Test Plan

JMeter test plans are created within the JMeter GUI. There, you can leverage JMeter's range of tools for specifying how your web application should be accessed and tested. JMeter even includes a recording feature for recording user behavior using browser actions.

Learn more about building test plans for JMeter in JMeter's [Building a Test Plan](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/build-test-plan.html) documentation. For the particular kind of test plan setup shown here, you may also refer to JMeter's [Building a Web Test Plan](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/build-web-test-plan.html) documentation.

The example test plan developed in this section specifically models web application access by several simultaneous users. The test verifies that users are able to access the page and that the page delivers the expected content.

From this base test, you can readily expand, both the number of modeled users and extent of scenarios, to fit your particular needs.

1. Open the JMeter GUI, and navigate to **File** > **Templates** from the top menu bar.

1. From the dropdown, select *Building a Web Test Plan*, and select the **Create** button. This creates a test plan from a template specifically for testing web applications.

1. The left bar should now have a test plan named *build-web-test-plan*. Under it, select the *Scenario 1* item.

    Doing so presents you with a **Thread Group** form. A thread group essentially defines a group of modeled users to run against your web application.

    For this example test plan, complete the form as follows. Leave any values not mentioned here at their defaults.

    - **Number of Threads**: `50`

    - **Ramp-up Period**: `1`

    - **Loop Count**: `5`

    - **Duration**: `30`

    ![Adjusting a thread group in a JMeter test plan](jmeter-thread-group.png)

1. Use the arrow to expand *Scenario 1*, and you should see HTTP and other configurations. These define how your modeled users (threads) should interact with your web application.

1. Select the *HTTP Requests Default* item. This sets up the default values for HTTP requests to be made by the modeled users. Give the values here, leaving anything not mentioned at its default value.

    - **Server Name or IP**: The public IP address or domain name for your web application; for example, `192.0.2.0`

    - **Port Number**: `3000`

    [![Adjusting the HTTP request defaults for a JMeter test plan](jmeter-http-defaults_small.png)](jmeter-http-defaults.png)

1. Select the *Home Page* item. This item defines a specific HTTP request to be made by the modeled users. For this example, you do not need to change anything with this. However, you can familiarize yourself with the item to have a better idea how to add custom ones later.

    As an idea, you would likely want similar HTTP request items, spaced with waiting intervals, for each page on your web application. These would then model a user's journey through your application.

    Should you want to add a new HTTP request item, you could do so with the following steps.

    1. Right-click (or control-click on Mac) the thread group â€” named *Scenario 1* in the template.

    1. Select **Add** > **Sampler** > **HTTP Request** from the menu.

    1. Select the resulting item from the left menu, and use the form to customize it to your needs.

1. Nested beneath the *Home Page* item is an *Assertion* item. Select this to get a **Response Assertion** form, which has JMeter look for a particular feature in the response.

    Under **Patterns to Test**, remove the default content, and replace it with `src/pages/index.tsx</code>`. Doing so establishes a test condition: When a modeled user accesses the home page, they should have the given text within the response.

    [![Adjusting the home page request assertion for a JMeter test plan](jmeter-assertion_small.png)](jmeter-assertion.png)

1. Once you have finished, use the **Save** option from the top toolbar or from the **File** menu to save the test plan. For this example, the test plan is saved as:

    - On Linux and Mac: `~/build-web-test-plan.jmx`

    - On Windows: `C:\Users\example-user\build-web-test-plan.jmx`

With that, you test plan is ready to run. Exit the JMeter GUI, and continue on to the next section to see how the test plan performs.

### Running the JMeter Load Test

To start running a load test with JMeter, you need to use its command-line interface (CLI). You access the CLI just as you would access the GUI, but adding the `-n` option to the command.

There are a few other command-line options you should leverage to effectively run your load tests with JMeter.

- `-t` designates the location of your test plan

- `-l` designates a location for a log file

- `-e` tells JMeter to create a report

- `-o` designates a directory to store the report in

Now you can put all of these together to run a load test using the test plan developed above. The example command here assumes the JMeter installation and the test plan are stored as described further above. Additionally, the command chooses to create a log file in the same directory as the test plan and creates another directory there for the report.

- On Linux and Mac:

    ```command
    ~/apache-jmeter-5.5/bin/jmeter -n -t ~/build-web-test-plan.jmx -l ~/build-web-test-logs.jtl -e -o ~/build-web-test-reports/
    ```

- On Windows:

    ```command
    C:\Users\example-user\apache-jmeter-5.5\bin\jmeter -n -t C:\Users\example-user\build-web-test-plan.jmx -l C:\Users\example-user\build-web-test-logs.jtl -e -o C:\Users\example-user\build-web-test-reports\
    ```

The load test begins immediately, and you should see summary output like the below on your command-line terminal.

```output
Creating summariser <summary>
Created the tree successfully using ../build-web-test-plan.jmx
Starting standalone test @ 2023 Apr 20 15:55:51 CDT (1682024151151)

Tidying up ...    @ 2023 Apr 20 15:56:03 CDT (1682024163082)
... end of run
```

When the load test finishes, the report is available as a generated HTML webpage, located in the report directory you specified in the command. Using the example above, you would find the webpage as `~/build-web-test-report/index.html` or `C:\Users\example-user\build-web-test-report\index.html`.
