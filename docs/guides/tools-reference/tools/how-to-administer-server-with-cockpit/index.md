It can be frustrating to manage a Linux server solely from the terminal, so users are always searching for an easier and more intuitive option. One of the more promising applications in this area is [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/). Cockpit allows users to monitor and configure a server through a graphical user interface. This guide explains how to use Cockpit on Linux for server management and provides some background about the application.

## What is Cockpit?

Cockpit is a server management tool that is available as a Linux plugin. It allows users to manage Linux systems using a web-based graphical interface and dashboard. Cockpit is designed for all users, both those who are new to Linux and experienced administrators. Cockpit is efficient, lightweight, and easy to use.

Cockpit provides a wrapper for Linux commands and uses existing system APIs, rendering it more robust against change. There is no requirement to remember the syntax of any command. Many tasks can be accomplished with a single click. Cockpit can co-exist with a web server, but a web server is not required to use Cockpit.

Here are some of Cockpit's advantages and features:

-   It is a free and open source application. Cockpit for Linux is available under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
-   It features an intuitive design. Each aspect of the server is separated into a different screen.
-   It allows users to change network settings, manage storage, configure a firewall, browse system logs, upgrade software, oversee user accounts, and enable system services.
-   It includes tools for monitoring performance and diagnosing network problems. It provides metrics for CPU utilization, memory use, network activity, and storage availability.
-   It incorporates a built-in terminal to allow users to toggle between the command line and GUI.
-   It can manage virtual machines, and download and run containers.
-   Cockpit allows users to quickly switch between multiple servers.
-   It is efficient and does not use resources when not active.
-   It provides multi-user support, allowing a team to manage a server.
-   It is compatible with existing tools like Ansible. Users can switch back and forth between tools as required.
-   Cockpit supports many optional and third-party extensions. These applications extend Cockpit's capabilities even further. A full list can be found on the [Cockpit applications page](https://cockpit-project.org/applications.html).
-   Cockpit includes a "starter kit" for creating custom and user-defined modules.

## Cockpit vs Other Server Management Tools

Cockpit is one of many available server management tools. Some of the other options include [Webmin](https://www.webmin.com/), [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/), and [cPanel](https://cpanel.net/). Each of these tools can be contrasted with Cockpit in terms of its own relative strengths and weaknesses.

-   **Netdata**: Netdata is a free and open source application for managing both systems and applications. It is known for its high-quality visualization and interactive tools. Netdata is considered a strong alternative to Cockpit, but it is more focused on real-time monitoring.
-   **Webmin**: Webmin is also a web-based system configuration tool. It can manage both Windows and Linux/UNIX systems. In addition to managing servers, Webmin can also modify applications and LAMP stack components. However, Cockpit is considered to have a more intuitive user interface.
-   **cPanel**: cPanel is best known as a web host manager. However, it can also manage many server configuration tasks. cPanel is very well known because many web hosting services provide it to their users at no extra cost. However, it does not focus on server management like Cockpit does. cPanel is a paid service, not a free or open source alternative.

Other tools including Ansible, Strapi, and Portainer serve complementary roles. They provide container management and IT automation tools, or serve primarily as *content management systems* (CMS). They can be used in conjunction with Cockpit to provide stronger capabilities in their area of expertise. In particular, Ansible and Cockpit are often used together, with Ansible providing an automation framework. Users can choose the best application for their current task.

## Before You Begin

1.  If you have not already done so, create a Linode account and Compute Instance. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/) and [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/) guides.

1.  Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

## How to Install Cockpit on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

These instructions are designed for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, but are generally valid for Ubuntu releases 20.xx and 18.xx as well. For other Linux distributions, refer to the [Cockpit installation instructions](https://cockpit-project.org/running.html).

### Installing Cockpit

To install Cockpit on Linux, follow these steps.

1.  Ensure software packages for the system are up to date. If prompted, press **Y** to continue and restart the system if necessary.

    ```command
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```

2.  Use `apt` to install Cockpit and press **Y** to continue.

    ```command
    sudo apt install cockpit
    ```

3.  The Ubuntu server does not start Cockpit automatically. Launch the Cockpit service using the `systemctl` service. Both the `cockpit` and `cockpit.socket` processes must be started.

    ```command
    sudo systemctl start cockpit cockpit.socket
    ```

4.  Confirm Cockpit is now running using the `systemctl status` command. When done, press **CTRL+C** to close the `systemctl status` output.

    ```command
    sudo systemctl status cockpit
    ```

    {{< output >}}
cockpit.service - Cockpit Web Service
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cockpit.service; static)
    Active: active (running) since Thu 2022-05-05 15:55:21 UTC; 5s ago
TriggeredBy: ‚óè cockpit.socket
    {{< /output >}}

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
Cockpit becomes dormant after a period of inactivity. In this case, it might display a status of `inactive (dead)`. Cockpit automatically wakes up when a user accesses it through its web interface. To confirm it is installed correctly, restart it using the previous instruction.
    {{< /note >}}

5. **(Optional)** To automatically activate Cockpit at start up, use the following command.

    ```command
    sudo systemctl enable cockpit cockpit.socket
    ```

6.  To allow Cockpit connections through the firewall, allow port `9090` in `ufw`. Ensure `ufw` is configured to allow `OpenSSH` before it is enabled. Enable the firewall after entering all commands and press **Y** to proceed.

    ```command
    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    sudo ufw allow 9090
    sudo ufw enable
    ```

7.  Verify the firewall status. `ufw` should have a status of `active` and port `9090` should be allowed through the firewall.

    ```command
    sudo ufw status
    ```

    {{< output >}}
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
9090                       ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
9090 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    {{< /output >}}

8. Cockpit is now ready to use. In a web browser, enter the IP address of the server, the `:` symbol, and port number `9090`. The Cockpit login page is then displayed.

    ```command
    https://Ip_address:9090/
    ```

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
If HTTPS is not enabled, the web browser displays a warning and tells the user the connection might not be safe. To bypass this warning, Click **Advanced** and then accept the certificate. The actual instructions vary depending on the browser.
