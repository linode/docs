The *tcpdump* tool provides a powerful command line option for network sniffing. With *tcpdump*, you can effectively capture and analyze network traffic, whether to diagnose network issues or to test network security.

In this tutorial, learn how to get started sniffing network traffic with *tcpdump*. See how to install *tcpdump*, how to read its output, and how to use it to capture and filter network packets.

## Before You Begin

1.  If you have not already done so, create a Linode account and Compute Instance. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/) and [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/) guides.

1.  Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

1.  Update your system:

    ```command {title="Debian / Ubuntu"}
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```

    ```command {title="AlmaLinux / CentOS Stream / Fedora / Rocky Linux"}
    sudo dnf upgrade
    ```

{{< note respectIndent=false >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/guides/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## How to Install tcpdump

The most straightforward way to install *tcpdump* is via your Linux system's package manager. Fortunately, *tcpdump* is available by default on most Linux distributions.

```command {title="Debian / Ubuntu"}
sudo apt install tcpdump
```

```command {title="AlmaLinux / CentOS Stream / Fedora / Rocky Linux"}
sudo dnf install tcpdump
```

You can verify your installation using the command below:

```command
sudo tcpdump --version
```

The command's output may vary, but it should be similar to what you see here:

{{< output >}}
tcpdump version 4.9.3
libpcap version 1.9.1 (with TPACKET_V3)
OpenSSL 1.1.1k  FIPS 25 Mar 2021
{{< /output >}}

## How to Interpret tcpdump Output

Before getting started using *tcpdump*, it can be useful to familiarize yourself with how *tcpdump* displays packets. In *tcpdump*, each line corresponds to a single packet, displayed in distinct sections. Here is an example from later on in this tutorial:

{{< output >}}
20:26:16.902555 IP example.hostname-one.com.ssh > example.hostname-two.com.64024: Flags [P.], seq 2957537435:2957537583, ack 850702985, win 1432, options [nop,nop,TS val 1668387813 ecr 3505486606], length 148
{{< /output >}}

Each packet's display breaks down like this, using the example above as a guide:

-   `20:26:16.902555` is the Unix timestamp, representing when the packet was sent. Refer to the [How to Use Advanced Display Options with tcpdump](/docs/guides/how-to-use-tcpdump-to-analyze-traffic/#how-to-use-advanced-display-options-with-tcpdump) section further on to see how you can display more human-readable timestamps instead.

-   `IP` is the network protocol. In this case, the packet is a TCP packet, which show up under the `IP` designation. An ICMP packet, by contrast, would show `ICMP` here.

-   `example.hostname-one.com.ssh > example.hostname-two.com.64024` are the source and destination hostnames. The source is before the `>` symbol, and the destination is after.

    The last entry on each host above, `.ssh` for the source and `.64024` for the destination, is the port.

    Refer to the [How to Use Advanced Display Options with tcpdump](/docs/guides/how-to-use-tcpdump-to-analyze-traffic/#how-to-use-advanced-display-options-with-tcpdump) section below to see how to display host IP addresses instead of hostnames.

-   The rest is query information.

    In the above, `Flag` indicates the TCP flag. The flags for TCP packets can be any combination of the following. Most often, the flag field contains a combination of one of these letter designations and the `.` symbol (like the `P.` in the example above):

    -   `S` for SYN
    -   `F` for FIN
    -   `P` for PUSH
    -   `R` for RST
    -   `U` for URG
    -   `W` for ECN CWR
    -   `E` for ECN-Echo
    -   `.` for ACK
    -   No flag, indicating that no flag is set for the packet

    Explanations of each flag can be found in the Wikipedia [page on TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure).

    DNS queries, by contrast, replace the `Flag` portion with the DNS query ID, something like `44000+`.

## How to Start Reading Network Traffic with tcpdump

These next sections show you how to get started using *tcpdump* for capturing and analyzing network traffic.

The example commands and output in these sections use `example.hostname-one.com` (also as `192.0.2.0`) and `example.hostname-two.com` (also as `198.51.100.0`) for hosts throughout this tutorial. Replace these with your own relevant hostnames/IP addresses when reproducing these examples.

### Finding Interfaces

*tcpdump* can provide a list of available network interfaces on your Linux system. In the next sections, these can be used to determine where you want to listen for packets.

To get a list of available interfaces, use the *tcpdump* command with the `-D` option:

```command
sudo tcpdump -D
```

{{< output >}}
1.eth0 [Up, Running]
2.lo [Up, Running, Loopback]
3.any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces) [Up, Running]
4.bluetooth-monitor (Bluetooth Linux Monitor) [none]
5.nflog (Linux netfilter log (NFLOG) interface) [none]
6.nfqueue (Linux netfilter queue (NFQUEUE) interface) [none]
7.usbmon0 (Raw USB traffic, all USB buses) [none]
{{< /output >}}

### Capturing Packets

You can begin capturing packets by simply executing the *tcpdump* command. By default, the command uses the lowest-numbered interface, which you can see from the command above would be `eth0`. However, it can be good practice to explicitly provide the interface, which you can accomplish with the `-i` option.

```command
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
```

You can stop capturing packets using the *Ctrl* + *C* key combination. And, as you may notice, the output from *tcpdump* can accumulate quickly. This is especially the case for broad, unfiltered searches like the one above.

You can make the output more manageable for the purposes of getting to know *tcpdump* by using the `-c` option. This option allows you to set a number of lines (packets) of output:

```command
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 5
```

5 packets captured
12 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
{{< /output >}}

*tcpdump* also gives you the option of capturing packets on all available interfaces, by specifying `any` as the interface. Doing so lets you cast an even wider net when observing network traffic:

```command
sudo tcpdump -i any
```

### Applying Filters

By itself, *tcpdump* produces a lot of output. It can accumulate quickly, making it difficult to find what you are looking for. That is why, most of the time, you are likely to want to use *tcpdump* with specific filters. These allow you to limit the captured packets based on certain criteria, keeping out many of the results that you do not need.

Here, you can see the primary filtering options available in *tcpdump*. In the next section, you can also see how to combine filters and use negative filters, allowing you to even further refine your packet capturing.

-   Port filtering can be accomplished using the `port` option followed by a specific port you want to observe network traffic on:

    ```command
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 1 port 80
    ```

    {{< output >}}

1 packet captured
1 packet received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
    {{< /output >}}

-   Host filtering can be accomplished using the `host` option followed by the IP address for a host you want to observe network traffic for:

    ```command
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 5 host 170.187.150.148
    ```

5 packets captured
10 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
    {{< /output >}}

-   Protocol filtering can be used to narrow results to only a given protocol type. You can accomplish this by simply appending the protocol designation to the *tcpdump* command:

    ```command
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 5 icmp
    ```

5 packets captured
5 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
    {{< /output >}}

### Combining Filters

Filters can be made even more effective by combining them using the logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not`. Here's an example that combines the host and port options:

```command
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 5 host 192.0.2.0 and port 80
```

The `not` operator can be used on its own as well:

```command
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 5 not port 80
```

### Saving Results

Often, the results from *tcpdump* are extensive, and sometimes you may want to save the results for deeper analysis at a later time. For that, you can use the *tcpdump* feature for saving results to a file.

This uses the `-w` option followed by the name of the file to save the results to:

```command
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 5 -w example-packet-dump.pcap
```

You can then read the results again right in *tcpdump*, using the `-r` option:

```command
sudo tcpdump -r example-packet-dump.pcap
```

## How to Use Advanced Display Options with tcpdump

*tcpdump* provides a number of options to control how results display. These range from making output easier to read to providing additional information about packets.

-   Use `-v` for verbose results, providing additional information for each packet. You can make the results even more verbose with `-vv`:

    ```command
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 5 -vv
    ```

-   Sometimes results are easier to interpret when hostnames are rendered as IP addresses. Alternatively, rendering hostnames as IP addresses may be essential when DNS resolution is unavailable. In these cases, you can use the `-n` option. This option shows hosts by their IP addresses:

    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n -c 5
    ```

## Conclusion

With that, you have a basis to start using *tcpdump* to capture and analyze traffic on your system's network. Building on the examples shown in this tutorial, you can effectively monitor traffic for issues or sniff packets to verify security.

To further enhance your *tcpdump* usage, take a look at the official [*tcpdump* man pages](https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/tcpdump.1.html) for a full account of the available command line options.
