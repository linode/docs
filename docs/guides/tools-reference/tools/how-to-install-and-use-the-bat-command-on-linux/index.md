The `bat` command is a clone of the ubiquitous `cat` command. It modernizes `cat` with a more readable design and features like syntax highlighting and a Git integration. This guide details how `bat` compares with its predecessor and shows you how to install and start using it on your Linux system.

## Before You Begin

1.  If you have not already done so, create a Linode account and Compute Instance. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/) and [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/) guides.

1.  Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

The steps in this guide are written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Linux Users and Groups](/docs/guides/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## bat vs. cat

You may be familiar with the Linux `cat` command. It is included in most distributions by default and gets referenced frequently as a quick way of viewing the contents of a file contents while on the command line.

Like `cat`, `bat` also gives you a simple command-line method for displaying file contents. But `bat` comes with a more modern display and several added features that set it apart.

For one, `bat` adds syntax highlighting. This, combined with other display enhancements — easier-to-follow formatting, pagination, graphical non-printing characters — makes `bat` exceptional for reading files that contain code.

`bat` also comes ready to integrate with several other command-line tools, chief among them is Git. By default, `bat` provides annotations to indicate modified lines for files tracked by Git. You can even use `bat` to view past versions of files under version control.

## How to Install bat

For many Linux distributions, you can get `bat` from the package manager. This is the case for Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora distributions.

- For **Debian** and **Ubuntu**, install `bat` using the following command:

        sudo apt install bat

    On Debian and Ubuntu, `bat` uses the `batcat` command by default because of a conflict with an existing package, `bacula-console-qt`. You can, however, use the following commands to link the `bat` command:

        mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
        ln -s /usr/bin/batcat ~/.local/bin/bat

    {{< note respectIndent=false >}}
If you have installed the `bacula-console-qt` package, be sure to remove it before executing the commands listed above. Otherwise, if you choose to keep `bacula-console-qt` installed, you must stick with using the `batcat` command instead of `bat`.
    {{< /note >}}

- For **Fedora**:

        sudo dnf install bat

For **AlmaLinux** and **CentOS**, a few more steps are required. For those distributions, follow the steps below to download the appropriate `bat` release and install it.

1. If you do not already have it, install `tar`, which you use to extract the `bat` package in a later step.

        sudo yum install tar

1. Check the CPU architecture of your Linux system using the following command:

        uname -a

    Here is an example of what your output might look like.

    {{< output >}}
Linux hostname 4.18.0-305.7.1.el8_4.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Jul 1 02:00:00 EDT 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    {{< /output >}}

    In this example — and in the commands that follow — the CPU architecture is **x86_64**.

1. Identify the latest version of `bat` from the [release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases). Find the corresponding `.tar.gz` package with your system's CPU architecture, followed by `unknown-linux-musl` in the name. Copy the URL for that release package. The URL is needed in the next step.

1. Copy the package's URL, and use the following command to download the package as `bat.zip`.

        curl -o bat.zip -L https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/download/v0.18.2/bat-v0.18.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz

1. Extract the package.

        tar -xvzf bat.zip

1. Move the `bat` files to `/usr/local`.

        sudo mv bat-v0.18.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl /usr/local/bat

1. Add an alias for `bat` to your `.bashrc` file. Likely, the file is located in your user's home directory, as in: `~/.bashrc`. You can create the alias by adding the following line to the end of the file.

    {{< file "~/.bashrc" >}}
[...]

alias bat="/usr/local/bat/bat"
    {{< /file >}}

Once you have installed `bat`, by whatever method, you can verify the installation using the `version` command.

    bat --version

{{< output >}}
bat 0.18.2
{{< /output >}}

## How to Use bat

Getting started with `bat` is similar to the basic usage of the `cat` command. You issue the `bat` command, followed by the path to a file you want to view.

To really show off the capabilities of `bat`, this guide uses some example code provided in the [Flask-RESTful GitHub project](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful). You can get the code by installing Git (if you do not already have it) and cloning the repository. Replace `apt` with `dnf` if you are on Fedora, and `yum` if you are on AlmaLinux or CentOS.

    sudo apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful.git

Now, you can open up one of the Python files in this repository using `bat`.

    bat flask-restful/examples/todo.py

![Python code in bat](bat-python-code.png)

By default, `bat` uses `less` to paginate its results. However, you can also have `bat` print to the command line, just like in `cat` with the `--paging=never` flag.

    bat --paging=never flask-restful/examples/todo.py

Like `cat`, `bat` gives the option to show non-printing characters, making it easier to track spaces, tabs, line breaks, etc. But `bat` has the added advantage of using special characters and highlighting to represent non-printing characters more clearly.

    bat --show-all flask-restful/examples/todo.py

![Python code with non-printing characters in bat](bat-python-code-nonprinting.png)

### Git Integration

`bat` also integrates with Git. To see it at work, open the `todo.py` file with your preferred text editor, and make some changes to it. Then, open the file again with `bat`. You can see that `bat` includes Git annotations on the modified lines.

![Python code with Git annotations in bat](bat-python-code-git.png)

Using a command combination between Git and `bat`, you can even `bat` to view past versions of files in a Git repository.

The method uses Git's `show` command, which requires you to specify a file version. Refer to the [Specifying Revisions](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#_specifying_revisions) section of Git's revisions documentation for the various ways of doing that.

The example below looks at past commits on the `todo.py` file shown above. It then gets a past version of the file using one of the commit's identifiers.

1. Change into the repository's directory. This example assumes you cloned the repository to your current user's home directory (`~`).

        cd ~/flask-restful

1. Get a list of commits on the file.

        git log examples/todo.py

## How to Customize Syntax Highlighting in bat

You can customize the syntax highlighting in `bat`. Whether you want a different color palette or you need to add highlighting support for a specific language, `bat` gives you customization options.

### Set the Highlighting Theme for bat

`bat` comes with a host of themes for syntax highlighting. You can get a list of them, along with samples, using the command below:

    bat --list-themes

![Excerpt from the list of bat themes](bat-themes-excerpt.png)

To select the theme you want to use, follow one of the options listed below:

- Use the `--theme` flag when running `bat`. With this method, you have to use the `--theme` flag each time you run the `bat` command.

        bat --theme="Solarized (dark)" ~/flask-restful/examples/todo.py

- Set the `BAT_THEME` environment variable for the shell session. This approach keeps the theme so long as your shell session is alive.

        export BAT_THEME="Solarized (dark)"

- Set the `BAT_THEME` environment variable in your `.bashrc` to make the theme selection persistent across your shell sessions.

    {{< file "~/.bashrc" >}}
[...]

export BAT_THEME="Solarized (dark)"
    {{< /file >}}

### Add Languages for Syntax Highlighting in bat

You can get a list of languages that your `bat` installation supports for syntax highlighting with the `--list-languages` option.

    bat --list-languages

If `bat` lacks highlighting for a language you want, you can add it yourself. `bat` supports Sublime Text syntax files — `.sublime-syntax`. There is also a package manager for Sublime Text called [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) that is used to install packages and keep them up-to-date.

The following steps show you how to add a language once you find a `.sublime-syntax` file you want to use. This example uses a package found on Package Control for the [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) programming language.

1. Create a `syntaxes` directory in the `bat` configuration directory.

        mkdir -p "$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes"

1. Place the `.sublime-syntax` file in this directory. This example clones the Git repository for the Fennel language package, which has the syntax file in its base.

        cd "$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes"
        git clone https://github.com/gbaptista/sublime-text-fennel.git

1. Have `bat` parse the syntax files.

        bat cache --build

1. Verify that your language option — Fennel, in this case — has been added to the list of languages in `bat`.

        bat --list-languages

    {{< output >}}
[...]
Fennel                            fnl
[...]
    {{< /output >}}
