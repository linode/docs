Elasticsearch, a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases, serves as the core of an Elastic Stack and centrally stores your data.

The resilient, highly available, indexed database quickly performs many types of searches - structured, unstructured, geo, metric - in various combinations. Also, its aggregations permit deeper analysis that renders data trends and patterns. Elasticsearch's intuitive APIs (RESTFul & JSON) give you complete visibility, control, monitoring and management over the system.
