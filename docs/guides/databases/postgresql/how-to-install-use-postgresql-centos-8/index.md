This guide demonstrates how to install and use [*PostgreSQL*](https://www.postgresql.org/), a popular open-source *object-relational database management system* (RDBMS). PostgreSQL enhances the original *Structured Query Language* (SQL) specification with many new features but still emphasizes compliance. PostgreSQL transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable which means the application is *ACID-compliant*. PostgreSQL ranks as one of the most widely-used database systems and is available for CentOS 8 and most other operating systems.

## Before You Begin

1. Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/getting-started/) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

1. This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [How to Secure Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server/) guide to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do **not** follow the [Configure a Firewall](/docs/guides/securing-your-server/#configure-a-firewall) section yet as this guide includes firewall rules specifically for an OpenVPN server.

1. Update your system:

        yum update

<!-- Include one of the following notes if appropriate. --->

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Linux Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of PostgreSQL

**Advantages of PostgreSQL:**

- PostgreSQL delivers many advanced utilities, including materialized views, triggers, and stored procedures.

- It is stable and capable of handling a very high workload, such as data warehouses and high-traffic web applications.

- PostgreSQL can integrate with clients from different languages, and you can extend it with custom data types and functions.

**Disadvantages of PostgreSQL:**

- PostgreSQL does not always match other database systems in terms of performance due to its focus on compatibility.
- Some open-source applications do not support PostgreSQL.

- In some cases, PostgreSQL can consume a large amount of disc space. For these situations, we recommend hosting PostgreSQL on a [*High Memory Linode*](https://www.linode.com/products/high-memory/).

## A Summary of the PostgreSQL Installation and Configuration Process

Installing PostgreSQL and performing basic configuration tasks consists of the following high-level steps. Each step is described in detail in the following sections:

1. Install PostgreSQL.
1. Secure PostgreSQL and Access the PostgreSQL Shell.
1. Install the PostgreSQL Administration Package.

## Install PostgreSQL

### Install the Latest Version of PostgreSQL From the CentOS Packages

If you do not require the absolute latest version of PostgreSQL, you can easily install it using the CentOS package installation program `yum`. This procedure installs the version of PostgreSQL that is included with the CentOS packages (currently version 10.15).

1. Use `yum` to update and upgrade the existing CentOS packages.

        sudo yum update

1. Install PostgreSQL and all dependencies, as well the `postgresql-contrib` component, which provides a set of useful extensions.

        sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
1. CentOS does not automatically initialize or enable PostgreSQL. You must first run the following command:

        sudo postgresql-setup --initdb
1. Launch PostgreSQL with `systemctl`.

        systemctl start postgresql.service
1. (**Optional**) You can configure PostgreSQL to automatically launch upon system boot-up with the `systemctl enable` directive.

        sudo systemctl enable postgresql.service
1. Confirm PostgreSQL is running by verifying its status in `systemctl`.

        systemctl status postgresql.service
    CentOS returns the status of the PostgreSQL service which should display as `active (running)`.
    {{< output >}}
postgresql.service - PostgreSQL database server
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
Active: active (running) since Tue 2021-02-02 14:04:08 UTC; 41s ago
    {{< /output >}}

### Install PostgreSQL From the PostgreSQL Yum Repository

If you want to choose a more specific version of PostgreSQL, you can install it from the PostgreSQL `yum` repository. The instructions below show you how to install the most recent stable version of PostgreSQL. At the time of writing this guide, the version of PostgreSQL is 13.1. You can also choose to install an earlier release of PostgreSQL.

1. Update and upgrade the existing packages.

        sudo yum update
1. Install the PostgreSQL repository.

        dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-8-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
1. Disable the built-in CentOS module.

        sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql
1. Use the new repository to install PostgreSQL along with the optional `postgresql-contrib` component, which many users find convenient. The following command installs PostgreSQL version 13.

        sudo dnf install -y postgresql13-server postgresql13-contrib
1. PostgreSQL is not automatically initialized or enabled on CentOS platforms. To initialize the database, run the following command:

        sudo postgresql-13-setup initdb
1. Start PostgreSQL with `systemctl`.

        systemctl start postgresql-13
1. (**Optional**) If you want PostgreSQL to automatically launch upon system boot-up, register it with `systemctl`.

        systemctl enable postgresql-13
1. Verify if the PostgreSQL service is active with `systemctl`.

        sudo systemctl status postgresql-13
    This returns a summary of the application's status. PostgreSQL should be listed as `active`.
    {{< output >}}
postgresql-13.service - PostgreSQL 13 database server
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/postgresql-13.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
Active: active (running) since Tue 2021-02-02 15:04:45 UTC; 1min 9s ago
Docs: <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/static/>
{{< /output >}}

{{< note >}}
If you require a specific minor release of PostgreSQL, you must obtain the source code from the [*PostgreSQL Downloads Page*](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/).

1. Locate the version and file you want, download and transfer it to your host, and extract the files with `tar`.
1. Follow the build instructions at [*Installation Procedure*](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-procedure.html) to complete the installation.

This process additionally provides you more control over the installation process.
{{< /note >}}

## Secure PostgreSQL and Access the PostgreSQL Shell

You should enhance the security of your PostgreSQL installation before proceeding further. During the installation, PostgreSQL automatically creates a default user account named `postgres` and grants this user full `superadmin` privileges. Therefore, it is crucial to apply Linux and database passwords to the account.

1. Create a strong password for the `postgres` Linux account and store it in a secure place.

        sudo passwd postgres
1. Switch over to this account with the `su` command.

        sudo su - postgres
1. Change the password that is required when the PostgreSQL user (`postgres`) connects over a network.

        psql -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'new password'"
    The `-d` option allows you to restrict the password to a specific database.

        psql -d template1 -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword'";
    {{< note >}}
This password does not apply when the `postgres` user logs in via the localhost. This ensures the account has administrative access to PostgreSQL for maintenance jobs and scripting access. Unless you override this setting, PostgreSQL always allows you to log in locally as `postgres` without any password.
    {{< /note >}}
1. Verify you can communicate with PostgreSQL and you are running the version you expect. The following command queries the PostgreSQL database for the current version.

        sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT version();"
    PostgreSQL returns information about the release, platform, and architecture.
    {{< output >}}
version

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PostgreSQL 13.1 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (GCC) 8.3.1 20191121 (Red Hat 8.3.1-5), 64-bit
(1 row)
    {{< /output >}}

1. Confirm you can access PostgreSQL by logging into the administrative `postgres` database.

        psql postgres
    PostgreSQL displays the application version and provides a prompt.
    {{< output >}}
psql (13.1)
Type "help" for help.
postgres=#
    {{< /output >}}
1. By default, local system users do not require a password to access PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL refers to this as `peer` authentication. This means it determines the system name of the user and validates it against the database privileges. We recommend you edit the `pg_hba.conf` file to force local users to provide a valid password. You can determine the location of this file by running the following command within the `psql` shell.

        SHOW hba_file ;
    PostgreSQL returns the location of the file.
    {{< output >}}
              hba_file

------------------------------------
/var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf
(1 row)
    {{< /output >}}

1. Exit PostgreSQL using the `\q` meta-command to return to the Linux shell.

        \q
    {{< note >}}
PostgreSQL commands starting with a backslash are called *meta-commands*. These pre-processed commands are helpful for administration and scripting purposes. See the [*PostgreSQL PSQL Documentation*](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) page for more information.
{{< /note >}}
1. Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file to require passwords from local users. Locate the line `local` under `Unix domain socket connections only` and change the `METHOD` attribute from `peer` to `md5`.

    However, we recommend you add a rule to exempt the default `postgres` user from the local password requirement. This allows for easier non-interactive access to PostgreSQL for maintenance tasks and scripting. Add a new line for the `postgres` user right above the rule for general local access. The entire section should now look like this.

    {{< file "/var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf" >}}
...

# Database administrative login by Unix domain socket

local   all             postgres                                peer

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only

local   all             all                                     md5
...
    {{< /file >}}
    {{< caution >}}
If you do not define this exception for the `postgres` user, you could potentially lock yourself out of the database. We recommend making a backup copy of this file before editing it and taking note of its location.
{{< /caution >}}

1. You must restart PostgreSQL to apply the new access rule.

        sudo systemctl restart postgresql-13

{{< note >}}
The `postgres` Linux user and the `postgres` database user are two different roles. The Linux account is used to access PostgreSQL, while the `postgres` PostgreSQL role is allowed to perform administrative tasks inside the database.
{{< /note >}}

## Install the PostgreSQL Administration Package

PostgreSQL's `Adminpack` module adds several management and administration tools. You can find out more about the module at the [*PostgreSQL documentation*](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/adminpack.html) site. The following process installs `Adminpack`.

1. Log in to the administrative `postgres` database in PostgreSQL.

        psql postgres
1. Create the extension.

        CREATE EXTENSION adminpack;
1. Verify the module is correctly installed with the `dx` meta-command.

        \dx
    `Adminpack` is now listed as one of the modules.
    {{< output >}}
List of installed extensions
   Name    | Version |   Schema   |               Description
-----------+---------+------------+-----------------------------------------
 adminpack | 2.1     | pg_catalog | administrative functions for PostgreSQL
 plpgsql   | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
    {{< /output >}}

## Using PostgreSQL

Like most common RDBMS systems, PostgreSQL uses fairly standard SQL commands. If you are familiar with SQL, the following sections should serve as a quick review. If not, the PostgreSQL documentation offers a good [starter tutorial](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/tutorial-sql.html).

### Work With PostgreSQL Databases

 You must create a database before you can define any tables or add any table rows. A database cluster collects all the databases that the single PostgreSQL server manages, while a database contains one or more tables. The [*PostgreSQL documentation*](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-createdb.html) discusses databases in far greater detail.

1. As the `postgres` Linux user, create a test database from the Linux shell using the `createdb` command.

        createdb testdatabase
    {{< note >}}
You can assign database ownership to a specific PostgreSQL user when you create it with the `-O` option, for example, `createdb testdatabase -O testuser`.
    {{< /note >}}
1. Connect directly to the new database.

        psql testdatabase
    The PostgreSQL prompt now displays the name of the new database.
    {{< output >}}
testdatabase=#
    {{< /output >}}
1. The `\l` meta-command lists all of the databases in the cluster.

        \l
    `testdatabase`now appears in the list.
    {{< output >}}
List of databases
     Name     |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges
--------------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 postgres     | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
 testdatabase | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
    {{< /output >}}
1. While you are logged into PostgreSQL, you can always determine the current database and your PostgreSQL role with the `conninfo` meta-command.

        \conninfo
    `Conninfo` returns details about your PostgreSQL connection.
{{< output >}}
You are connected to database "testdatabase" as user "postgres" via socket in "/var/run/postgresql" at port "5432".
{{< /output >}}
1. You can always switch to a different database without logging out of PostgreSQL via the `\c` meta-command.

        \c postgres
1. You can delete a database with the `dropdb` command, but first ensure you no longer need it. Execute the `dropdb` command from the Linux shell as the `postgres` user.

        dropdb testdatabase

{{< caution >}}
The `dropdb` command permanently deletes all of the tables and data inside the database and cannot be undone.
{{< /caution >}}

### Work With PostgreSQL Tables

A database table refers to an ordered sequence of named columns. Each column is defined together with its data type, for example,`int`. You can find more details about tables and table creation in the [*PostgreSQL documentation*](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/ddl-basics.html).

Follow these steps to create a table within the `testdatabase` database.

1. Connect to the database.

        psql testdatabase
1. Add a new table called `customers` with the `CREATE TABLE` SQL command. Provide a list of columns, along with a data type for each column as parameters to the command.

        CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id int, first_name varchar(80), last_name varchar(80));
1. List all of the tables in the database using the `\dt` meta-command.

        \dt
    PostgreSQL returns a table-formatted list showing all of the tables in the database, along with some other information.
    {{< output >}}
List of relations
 Schema |   Name    | Type  |  Owner
--------+-----------+-------+----------
 public | customers | table | postgres
(1 row)
   {{< /output >}}

1. You can itemize all of the columns in the `customers` table, including all of the data types, with the `\d+` meta-command.

        \d+ customers
    {{< output >}}
Table "public.customers"
   Column    |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage  | Stats target | Description
-------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------+----------+--------------+-------------
 customer_id | integer               |           |          |         | plain    |              |
 first_name  | character varying(80) |           |          |         | extended |              |
 last_name   | character varying(80) |           |          |         | extended |              |
{{< /output >}}

1. The `DROP TABLE` command can be used to delete an existing table.

        DROP TABLE customers;
    {{< caution >}}
The `DROP TABLE` operation deletes all of the data in the table. It cannot be undone.
{{< /caution >}}

### Work With PostgreSQL Columns

It is a good practice to finalize your database schema and table layout before adding any data. However, if you need to add or drop columns, later on, PostgreSQL provides functions to allow you to do so.

1. To add a column to a pre-existing table, use the `ALTER TABLE` command. This field is set to empty in all existing rows.

        ALTER TABLE customers ADD branch_id int;
1. You can use the `ALTER TABLE` command along with the `DROP` keyword to delete a column. PostgreSQL removes this column from all rows and removes the associated data.

        ALTER TABLE customers DROP first_name;
1. You can use the `d+` meta-command to display the new table structure after your changes.

        \d+ customers
    PostgreSQL returns a list of all of the columns that are currently part of the table.
    {{< output >}}
Table "public.customers"
   Column    |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage  | Stats target | Description
-------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------+----------+--------------+-------------
customer_id | integer               |           |          |         | plain    |              |
last_name   | character varying(80) |           |          |         | extended |              |
branch_id   | integer               |           |          |         | plain    |              |
{{< /output >}}

### Add and Read Data With PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL tables store the data entries as a series of rows. A row can be thought of as a single record within the table with values for each of the columns. Depending on the table's definition, some columns might not require a value. The `INSERT` command adds data to a PostgreSQL table on a row-by-row basis. Data can later be retrieved with the `SELECT` command. For more information about how to add and read data from a table, see the [*PostgreSQL Documentation*](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/dml-insert.html).

1. To add entries into a table, first connect to the database.

        psql testdatabase
1. Add two rows to the `customers` table with the `INSERT` command. Provide the table name, along with a list of the values to insert, separated by commas. The order of the values and the order of the table columns must match exactly.

        INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'John', 'Client');
        INSERT INTO customers VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Purchaser');
1. Use the `SELECT` command to retrieve some or all of the contents of a table. In its simplest form, `SELECT` returns all of the data from a table.

        SELECT * FROM customers;
    PostgreSQL returns a table showing all the columns from all the rows in the table.
    {{< output >}}
 customer_id | first_name | last_name
-------------+------------+-----------
           1 | John       | Client
           2 | Jane       | Purchaser
(2 rows)
    {{< /output >}}
    {{< note >}}
The `*` symbol represents a wild card. In this case, it indicates all columns.
    {{< /note >}}

1. You can restrict a query to return only a subset of the columns by listing the specific columns you want. Only those columns (from all rows) are retrieved.

        SELECT last_name FROM customers;
    PostgreSQL returns a list of the customer last names.
   {{< output >}}
 last_name

-----------
 Client
 Purchaser
(2 rows)
   {{< /output >}}

1. You can use the `WHERE` keyword along with a search condition to conditionally select rows. PostgreSQL treats the search condition as a Boolean expression and returns each row in which the expression evaluates to `true`. The following example looks for a particular value in the `last_name` column. However, PostgreSQL supports more complicated expressions involving multiple comparisons and set operations.

        SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name = 'Client';
    PostgreSQL returns the only row matching the search criteria.
       {{< output >}}
 customer_id | first_name | last_name
-------------+------------+-----------
           1 | John       | Client
(1 row)
   {{< /output >}}
1. You can remove rows from a PostgreSQL table with the `DELETE` command. Conditionally select rows to delete with the `WHERE` keyword which works the same way it does in the `SELECT` command. If you use the `*` symbol, all rows are deleted.

        DELETE FROM customers WHERE last_name = 'Purchaser';

1. You can edit rows using the `UPDATE` command. Specify one or more columns to edit along with the new values. In almost every case, you should include a conditional `WHERE` clause to designate the rows where the change should be applied.

        UPDATE customers SET last_name= 'Buyer' WHERE customer_id = '1';
1. If you select the entire `customers` table, you can see the updated values. In this case, only one row remains.

        SELECT * FROM customers;
    {{< output >}}
        customer_id | first_name | last_name
-------------+------------+-----------
           1 | John       | Buyer
(1 row)
   {{< /output >}}

    {{< note >}}
A *join* is a complex query that combines information from two or more tables. To execute a join, indicate a column from each table where the values must match. Every time a match occurs, the join operation returns the pair of relevant rows (one from each table). For instance, if `branch_id` is the same in a row in the `branches` table and another in the `employees` table, both rows are returned. Depending on how your tables are designed, matches might be one-to-one, many-to-one, or many-to-many. PostgreSQL processes the matching rows into one entity and retrieves the requested columns.

You can learn more about [*Joins*](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/tutorial-join.html) on the PostgreSQL site.
    {{< /note >}}

### Create PostgreSQL Roles (Users) and Groups

If you are the only person using an instance of PostgreSQL, you probably only need the default `postgres` account. In all other cases, we recommend you create a separate account for each user.

This section explains how to create new PostgreSQL roles (users) and place them into groups.

1. From the Linux shell as the `postgres` user, add a new PostgreSQL role with `createuser` command.

        createuser testuser --pwprompt
    PostgreSQL prompts you for a password for `testuser`. Choose a high-security password and enter it twice.
1. Enter the PostgreSQL shell and execute the `\du` meta-command to verify the role has been created.

        \du
    PostgreSQL returns an overview of all the roles in the database. Notice that the `testuser` does not have any attributes (or privileges) yet.
    {{< output >}}
 Role name |                         Attributes                         | Member of
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}
 testuser  |                                                            | {}
    {{< /output >}}
1. Access the database as `testuser` in the following manner.

        psql testdatabase -U testuser
    PostgreSQL displays a slightly different prompt this time.
    {{< output >}}
testdatabase=>
    {{< /output >}}
1. You can add privileges to user accounts with the `GRANT` command. To grant `testuser` full access to the `customers` table, access the database as the `postgres` user and enter the following command:

        GRANT ALL ON customers TO testuser;
1. You can add or remove user permissions with the `ALTER ROLE` command. The following command allows the `postgres` user to create databases.

        ALTER ROLE testuser CREATEDB;
    The `\du` command shows the access level for all users.
    {{< output >}}
List of roles
Role name |                         Attributes                         | Member of
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}
testuser  | Create DB                                                  | {}
    {{< /output >}}
1. You can create groups in order to grant access to many users at one time. From the Linux shell as the `postgres` user, run the following command:

        createuser testgroup --no-login
1. Log in to the database as the `postgres` user and assign `testuser` to the new group.

        GRANT testgroup TO testuser;
1. Use the `\du` meta-command to list all the groups and roles along with the membership details.

        \du

        dropuser testgroup

## Access PostgreSQL Remotely

There is a security risk in opening up PostgreSQL to listen for remote connections. For more secure remote access to PostgreSQL, use a Graphical User Interface such as pgAdmin.

The following Linode guides provide more information on pgAdmin:

- [How to Access PostgreSQL Database Remotely Using pgAdmin on Windows](/docs/databases/postgresql/pgadmin-windows)
- [Securely Manage Remote PostgreSQL Servers with pgAdmin on Mac OS X](/docs/databases/postgresql/pgadmin-macos-x)

## Learn More About PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL can be a complicated application with many options. Our guide only covers the basics, so we recommend you spend more time learning about PostgreSQL.

1. The [*PostgreSQL*](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/index.html) documentation is complete and comprehensive and includes an [introductory tutorial](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/tutorial.html) that is great for beginners.
1. PostgreSQL also has an active user base and community. You can find out more about these user groups on the [*PostgreSQL*](https://www.postgresql.org/community/) site.
