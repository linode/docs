This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you're not familiar with the `sudo` command, visit our [Users and Groups](/docs/guides/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.

All configuration files should be edited with elevated privileges. Remember to include `sudo` before running your text editor.
