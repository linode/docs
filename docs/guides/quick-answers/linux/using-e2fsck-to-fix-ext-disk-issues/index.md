## What is e2fsck?

**e2fsck** is a utility that examines `ext2`, `ext3`, and `ext4` filesystems for errors, and attempts to repair them if possible. It is the backend tool that the popular [fsck](/docs/guides/how-to-use-fsck-to-fix-disk-problems/) frontend utility calls for a combination of tasks related to `ext` filesystems.

On some systems, e2fsck runs automatically after an unclean shutdown or after a certain number of reboots.

{{< note respectIndent=false >}}
When booting into rescue mode on the Linode Platform, the `e2fsck` tool will be installed as the default disk repair utility. For instructions specific to performing a filesystem check on the Linode platform, see our [Troubleshooting Guide: Booting into Rescue Mode](/docs/guides/rescue-and-rebuild/#booting-into-rescue-mode) for guidance.

## When to Use e2fsck

You can use fsck to check your file system if your system fails to boot, if files on a specific disk become corrupt, or if an attached drive does not act as expected.
Unmount the disks you intend to work on before attempting to check or repair them.

{{< note type="alert" respectIndent=false >}}
Unmount the target disk first. You risk corrupting your file system and losing data if you run fsck on an active disk.

## e2fsck Options and Arguments

| Option | Action |
| ------:|:------------------ |
| `-a`   | Automatically repair ("preen") the file system. This option is provided for backwards compatibility purposes only, and it is recommended that the `-p` option is used instead wherever possible. |
| `-b superblock`   | Uses an alternative superblock, replacing `superblock` as noted in the option. |
| `-B blocksize`   | Allows you to define a block size when performing e2fsck, instead of having e2fsck attempt multiple block sizes to find the correct one. Replace `blocksize` with the block size you would like to attempt a repair with.  |
| `-c`   | Uses the [badblocks](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/badblocks.8.html#) program to perform a read-only scan to find any bad blocks, and then add any back blocks to the inode to prevent them from being allocated. |
| `-C fd`   | Ensures that e2fsck writes completion information to a specified file descriptor to track the progress of the file system check. Replace `fd` with the file descriptor you would like to use. |
| `-d`   | Prints debugging output |
| `-D`   | Ensures the e2fsck attempts to optimize all directories by re-indexing them or by sorting and compressing directories for smaller directories, or traditional linear directories.  |
| `-E extended_options`   | Sets extended options for e2fsck. These are generally more advanced options. For more information, see the [official man page for e2fsck.](https://linux.die.net/man/8/badblocks) |
| `-f`   | Force filesystem checking even if the file system appears clean.  |
| `-F`   | Flushes the file system device's buffer caches before beginning. This is generally only useful for benchmarking purposes. |
| `-j external-journal`   | Sets the path name where the external-journal for the defined file system can be found. Replace `external-journal` with the path you will be using. |
| `-k` | Used in combination with the `-c` option, uses the [badblocks](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/badblocks.8.html#) program, ensures that any existing bad blocks are preserved, and any new bad blocks found are added to the bad blocks list. |
| `-l filename` | Adds block numbers listed in the file specified by `filename` to the list of bad blocks. |
| `-L filename` | Same as the `l` option, however clears the bad blocks list before the blocks listed in the file are added. |
| `-n` | Opens the filesystem as `read-only` and assumes an answer of `no` to any prompts. This option may not be specified at the same time as the -p or -y options. |
| `-p` | Entered to automatically repair ("preen") the file system. Automatically attempts to fix any filesystem issues without human intervention. |
| `-t` | Prints statistics for `e2fsck` related to timing. |
| `-v` | Enables verbose output. |
| `-V` | Prints the version information for  `e2fsck` without performing any scan. |
| `-y` | Automatically selects the `yes` option to any prompts when performing `e2fsck` tasks. This option may not be specified at the same time as the `-n` or `-p` options. |


## Unmount the Disk

### Boot into Rescue Mode

If you are using e2fsck on a Linode, the easiest and safest way to unmount your disk is to use Rescue Mode. Visit our [Rescue and Rebuild](/docs/guides/rescue-and-rebuild/#booting-into-rescue-mode) guide for instructions on how to boot your Linode into Rescue Mode. If you're working on a local machine, consider using the distribution's recovery mode or a live distribution to avoid working on a mounted disk. e2fsck should be run only as a user with root permissions.

### View Mounted Disks and Verify Disk Location

1.  Run `df` to view a list of currently mounted disks. If you are using Rescue Mode, the disk you want to check should not be listed:

        df -h

2.  Use `fdisk` to view disk locations:

        fdisk -l

    Copy the location of the target disk to use with the fsck command.

### Configuration Profile

If you are working on a Linode but do not wish to use Rescue Mode, shut down the Linode from the Linode Manager. Unmount the disk from the [Configuration Profile](/docs/guides/linode-configuration-profiles). Apply the changes and reboot the Linode.

### Manual Unmount

If you are working on a local machine, unmount the disk manually.

1.  Use `umount` to unmount the disk location copied in the [previous step](#view-mounted-disks-and-verify-disk-location):

        umount /dev/sdb

2.  If the disk is declared in `/etc/fstab`, change the `mount point` to `none` there as well.

## How to Check for Errors on a Disk

Run fsck on the target disk, using the desired options. This example forces a file system check and attempts to fix any issues without human intervention (`-fp`) on `/dev/sda`:

    e2fsck -pf /dev/sda

### Understand fsck Error Codes

The error codes that fsck returns can be understood with the following table from [man7.org](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fsck.8.html):

| Code | Error Code Meaning |
| ----:|:------------------ |
|   0 | No errors  |
|   1 | Filesystem errors corrected  |
|   2 | System should be rebooted  |
|   4 | Filesystem errors left uncorrected  |
|   8 | Operational error  |
|  16 | Usage or syntax error  |
|  32 | Checking canceled by user request  |
| 128 | Shared-library error  |
