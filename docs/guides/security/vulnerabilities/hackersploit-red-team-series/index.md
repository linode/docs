The rate of data breaches and APT attacks has been rapidly increasing during the period of COVID-19. Organizations are starting to recognize that their IT infrastructure has weaknesses and vulnerabilities, at great expense to their operations and customer data. For medium to large enterprise organizations, a defense-in-depth strategy that includes testing your defenses is required. This is where red teaming comes into play.

The objective of red teaming is to determine the weaknesses that can affect the organization and determine the effectiveness of the defenses currently in place.

This series aims to teach infosec and cybersecurity professionals the various red team techniques that can be used to attack and determine vulnerabilities in their organization’s security.
