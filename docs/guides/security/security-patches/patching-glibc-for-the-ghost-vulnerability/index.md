GHOST is a vulnerability that was announced on January 27th 2015, which affects the glibc library on Linux systems.  This vulnerability affects all Linux distributions running versions of glibc older than 2.18, and exploits a buffer overflow in the `__nss_hostname_digits_dots()` function. This guide will tell you how to safely upgrade your Linux distributions and secure your Linode against the GHOST vulnerability.

`glibc` is the new implementation of the C standard library. And there are many glibc modules, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc and they all have their own glibc versions.  Usually, any Linux based operating system uses this new implementation. Windows and other BSDs use other forms of libc libraries.

## What Is GHOST Vulnerability?

GHOST vulnerability is a critical bug that affected existing versions of libc that were commonly being used in 2015. It mainly affected `gethostbyname2()` and `gethostbyname()` functions in `glibc`.

With GHOST vulnerability, an attacker can execute any code they want by leveraging user level permissions.

This `gethostbyname()` function for example converts hostname to IPv4 addresses. And to connect to any particular host, you call gethostbyname() to get that host's IPv4 address and then you open a socket to that host. In 2015, pretty much every network software was using this function.

The actual vulnerability in these function calls was that, before they can actually convert a hostname to an IPv4 address, they have to check if the parameter passed to the function call is already an IPv4 address. When that happens, the function does not calculate the size of the buffer correctly, missing out the size of one pointer.

When `gethostbyname()` miscalculates the buffer size, it doesn’t have enough memory leading to a small buffer overflow of 4 bytes for a 32-bit system, or 8 bytes for a 64-bit system.

## How To Patch And Protect Unix Systems Against The glibc GHOST Vulnerability?

To patch and protect your Unix systems using GHOST vulnerable glibc, simply update the glibc versions.

## How To Find Packages Or Applications That Depend On Glibc?

To find packages or applications on your system that depend on vulnerable glibc, run the following command:

        lsof | grep libc | awk ‘{print $1}’ | sort | uniq

This gives you the list of packages and applications in the output on your terminal.


## Which Operating Systems and glibc Libraries Were Impacted by Glibc GHOST Vulnerability?

The following glibc libraries were impacted by the GHOST vulnerability:
*   glibc-2.17
*   glibc-2.18
*   glibc-2.19
*   glibc-2.2

Operating systems impacted by glibc:
*   Debian 7
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7
*   Centos 6 & 7
*   Ubuntu 12.04 
*   Majority of the BSD variants expect for Mac OSX, OpenBSD, FreeBSD

## glibc Patches Available and Distributions Unaffected By The GHOST Vulnerability

glibc GHOST vulnerability patches are currently available for the following operating systems:
* Debian 7
* CentOS 6 & 7
* Ubuntu 12.04.

Distributions that are unaffected are as follows:

* Fedora 20 & 21
* Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10

Prior unsupported versions of the listed distributions may not have patches available.  It is recommended to upgrade any systems still running unsupported distributions.

## Checking Installed glibc Version For The GHOST Vulnerability

You can check the version of glibc on your system using your package manager.

### Checking glibc On Debian and Ubuntu For The GHOST Vulnerability

To check the version of glibc on your system, run the following command. In the output, look for the line beginning with `Version:`:

    # aptitude show libc6
    Package: libc6
    State: installed
    Automatically installed: no
    Multi-Arch: same
    Version: 2.13-38+deb7u6
    Priority: required
    Section: libs
    Maintainer: GNU Libc Maintainers <debian-glibc@lists.debian.org>
    Architecture: amd64
    Uncompressed Size: 9,687 k
    Depends: libc-bin (= 2.13-38+deb7u6), libgcc1
    Suggests: glibc-doc, debconf | debconf-2.0, locales
    Conflicts: prelink (<= 0.0.20090311-1), tzdata (< 2007k-1), tzdata-etch
    Breaks: locales (< 2.13), locales-all (< 2.13), lsb-core (<= 3.2-27), nscd (< 2.13)
    Replaces: libc6-amd64
    Provides: glibc-2.13-1
    Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Shared libraries
     Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C library and the
     standard math library, as well as many others.
    Homepage: http://www.eglibc.org

On Debian 7 systems, versions of glibc earlier than `2.13-38+deb7u7` are vulnerable, and on Ubuntu 12.04, versions before `2.15-0ubuntu10.10`.

### Checking glibc On CentOS 6 & 7 For The GHOST Vulnerability

To check the version of glibc on your system, run the following command. In the output, look for the line beginning with `Release:` under the `Installed Packages` heading:

    # yum info glibc

    ....

    Installed Packages
    Name        : glibc
    Arch        : x86_64
    Version     : 2.17
    Release     : 55.el7_0.1
    Size        : 13 M
    Repo        : installed
    From repo   : updates
    Summary     : The GNU libc libraries
    URL         : http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/
    License     : LGPLv2+ and LGPLv2+ with exceptions and GPLv2+
    Description : The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
                : multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
                : memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
                : kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
                : contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
                : library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
                : Linux system will not function.

On CentOS 7 systems, versions of glibc before `glibc-2.17-55.el7_0.5` are vulnerable, and on CentOS 6 versions before `glibc-2.12-1.149.el6_6.5`.

## Testing with GCC For The GHOST Vulnerability

The original security advisory for CVE-2015-0235 included the following code to test for the vulnerability. This method requires that you have `gcc` installed on your system. If you don't, you can install it from your package manager, or use the alternate check above.

1.  Create a `GHOST.c` file with the following contents.

    {{< file "~/GHOST.c" C >}}
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>

# define CANARY "in_the_coal_mine"

struct {
  char buffer[1024];
  char canary[sizeof(CANARY)];
} temp = { "buffer", CANARY };

int main(void) {
  struct hostent resbuf;
  struct hostent *result;
  int herrno;
  int retval;

  /*** strlen (name) = size_needed - sizeof (*host_addr) - sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) - 1; ***/
  size_t len = sizeof(temp.buffer) - 16*sizeof(unsigned char) - 2*sizeof(char *) - 1;
  char name[sizeof(temp.buffer)];
  memset(name, '0', len);
  name[len] = '\0';

  retval = gethostbyname_r(name, &resbuf, temp.buffer, sizeof(temp.buffer), &result, &herrno);

  if (strcmp(temp.canary, CANARY) != 0) {
    puts("vulnerable");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  if (retval == ERANGE) {
    puts("not vulnerable");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  puts("should not happen");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

{{< /file >}}


2.  Compile the script.

        gcc GHOST.c -o GHOST

3.  Execute the compiled GHOST script.  Your terminal should print "vulnerable" or "not vulnerable" depending on your system's status.

        ./GHOST

## Installing The glibc Upgrade

Below is the relevant information for upgrading glibc and ensuring that your Linode is no longer vulnerable to the bug. Each section is designed for individual distributions. The sections are written with the assumption that you have root access or sudo privileges. If you do not, you will not be able to run these commands.

{{< note >}}
You will need to reboot after completing your upgrade to ensure that the vulnerable code no longer remains in your system memory.  Once you have rebooted, we would recommend re-running the script created in the [Testing with GCC](#testing-with-gcc) section to confirm that the patch has been applied
{{< /note >}}

### Upgrading glibc On Ubuntu and Debian

To upgrade glibc on Ubuntu and Debian, run these commands to update and upgrade via the package manager. If you are not running as the root user, prepend `sudo` to each command:

{{< caution >}}
If you have packages that have older dependencies, you may want to utilize apt-get with the upgrade flag, rather than dist-upgrade.  This will prevent packages with older dependencies from being removed from your system.  If using this method, be sure to check your command output to ensure that the patched version of glibc is actually installed.
{{< /caution >}}

    apt-get update
    apt-get dist-upgrade

### Upgrading glibc On CentOS and Fedora

To upgrade glibc on yum based systems such as CentOS and Fedora, run these commands to update and upgrade via the package manager. If you are not running as the root user, prepend `sudo` to each command:

    yum clean all
    yum update

## Does yum upgrade patches GHOST vulnerability?

Yes, if you update glibc using Yum package manager and reboot your system, you should be secured against glibc GHOST vulnerability.


## How To Update glibc without Yum?

If for some reason you don’t have access to the yum package manager, you can update glibc from rpm instead. To upgrade your glibc using rpm download relevant glibc files, for example, we can download the following to update to 2.17 version:
*   glibc-devel-2.17-317.el7.i686.rpm
*   glibc-common-2.32-2.fc33.x86_64.rpm
*   glibc-headers-2.28-141.el8.x86_64.rpm
*   glibc-2.28-141.el8.x86_64.rpm
*   nscd-2.28-141.el8.x86_64.rpm

Once you have these files on your system. You can run the following command to update your glibc version:

rpm -Uvh *.rpm

Running the above command will update all .rpm files in your system.
