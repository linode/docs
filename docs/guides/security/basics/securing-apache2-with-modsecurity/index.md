## What is ModSecurity?

ModSecurity is a free and open source web application that started out as an Apache module and grew to a fully-fledged web application firewall. It works by inspecting requests sent to the web server in real time against a predefined rule set, preventing typical web application attacks like XSS and SQL Injection.

## Prerequisites & Requirements

In order to install and configure ModSecurity, you need to have a Linux server with the following services running:

- Apache 2

For instructions, see our guide on [How to Install Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](/docs/guides/how-to-install-apache-web-server-ubuntu-18-04/). Installation instructions for several other Linux distributions are also accessible from this guide.

{{< note >}}
This demonstration has been performed on Ubuntu 18.04. However, all techniques demonstrated are distribution agnostic with the exception of package names and package managers.

## Installing ModSecurity

1.  ModSecurity can be installed by running the following command in your terminal:

        sudo apt install libapache2-mod-security2 -y

1.  Alternatively, you can also build ModSecurity manually by cloning the official [ModSecurity Github repository](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity).

1.  After installing ModSecurity, enable the Apache 2 `headers` module by running the following command:

        sudo a2enmod headers

After installing ModSecurity and enabling the header module, you need to restart the apache2 service, this can be done by running the following command:

        sudo systemctl restart apache2

You should now have ModSecurity installed. The next steps involves enabling and configuring ModSecurity and the OWASP-CRS.

## Configuring ModSecurity

ModSecurity is a firewall and therefore requires rules to function. This section shows you how to implement the OWASP Core Rule Set. First, you must prepare the ModSecurity configuration file.

1. Remove the `.recommended` extension from the ModSecurity configuration file name with the following command:

        sudo cp /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf

1.  With a text editor such as vim, open `/etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf` and change the value for `SecRuleEngine` to `On`:

    {{< file "/etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf" aconf >}}
# -- Rule engine initialization ----------------------------------------------

# Enable ModSecurity, attaching it to every transaction. Use detection
# only to start with, because that minimises the chances of post-installation
# disruption.
#
SecRuleEngine On
...
    {{< /file >}}

1.  Restart Apache to apply the changes:

        sudo systemctl restart apache2

ModSecurity should now be configured to run. The next step in the process is to set up a rule set to actively prevent your web server from attacks.

## Setting Up the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set

The [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts. The CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, and Local File Inclusion.

To set up the OWASP-CRS, follow the procedures outlined below.

1.  First, delete the current rule set that comes prepackaged with ModSecurity by running the following command:

        sudo rm -rf /usr/share/modsecurity-crs

1.  Ensure that git is installed:

        sudo apt install git

1.  Clone the OWASP-CRS GitHub repository into the `/usr/share/modsecurity-crs` directory:

        sudo git clone https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset /usr/share/modsecurity-crs

1.  Rename the `crs-setup.conf.example` to `crs-setup.conf`:

        sudo mv /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf.example /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf

1.  Rename the default request exclusion rule file:

        sudo mv /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules/REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS.conf.example /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules/REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS.conf

You should now have the OWASP-CRS setup and ready to be used in your Apache configuration.

## Enabling ModSecurity in Apache 2

To begin using ModSecurity, enable it in the Apache configuration file by following the steps outlined below:

1.  Using a text editor such as vim, edit the `/etc/apache2/mods-available/security2.conf` file to include the OWASP-CRS files you have downloaded:

    {{< file "/etc/apache2/mods-available/security2.conf" aconf>}}
<IfModule security2_module>
        SecDataDir /var/cache/modsecurity
        Include /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf
        Include /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules/*.conf
</IfModule>
    {{< /file >}}

1.  In `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf` file `VirtualHost` block, include the `SecRuleEngine` directive set to `On`.

    {{< file "/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf" aconf >}}
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        SecRuleEngine On
</VirtualHost>
    {{< /file >}}

    If you are running a website that uses SSL, add `SecRuleEngine` directive to that website's configuration file as well. See our guide on [SSL Certificates with Apache on Debian & Ubuntu](/docs/guides/ssl-apache2-debian-ubuntu/#configure-apache-to-use-the-ssl-certificate) for more information.

1.  Restart the apache2 service to apply the configuration:

        sudo systemctl restart apache2

ModSecurity should now be configured and running to protect your web server from attacks. You can now perform a quick test to verify that ModSecurity is running.

## Testing ModSecurity

Test ModSecurity by performing a simple local file inclusion attack by running the following command:

    curl http://<SERVER-IP/DOMAIN>/index.php?exec=/bin/bash

If ModSecurity has been configured correctly and is actively blocking attacks, the following error is returned:
