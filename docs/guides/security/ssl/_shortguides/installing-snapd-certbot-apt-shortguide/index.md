## Installing Snapd

[Snap](https://snapcraft.io/about) is a package manager developed by Canonical (creators of Ubuntu). Software is packaged as a *snap* (self-contained application and dependencies) and the *snapd* tool is used to manage these packages. Since certbot is packaged as a snap, we'll need to install snapd before installing certbot. While it's installed by default on Ubuntu 16.04 and later, its also available for most other Linux distributions.

1.  If snapd is not installed, install it now.

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install snapd

1.  Install the *core* snap.

        sudo snap install core
        sudo snap refresh core

## Installing Certbot

The next step is to install Certbot using the snap command.

1.  Remove any previously installed certbot packages to avoid conflicts with the new Snap package.

        sudo apt remove certbot

1.  Use Snap to install Certbot.

        sudo snap install --classic certbot

1.  Configure a symbolic link to the Certbot directory using the `ln` command.

        sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
