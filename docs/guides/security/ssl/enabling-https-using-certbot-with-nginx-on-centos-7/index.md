This guide provides instructions on using the open source [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) utility with the NGINX web server on CentOS 7 and RHEL 7. Certbot dramatically reduces the effort (and cost) of securing your websites with HTTPS. It works directly with the free [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority to request (or renew) a certificate, prove ownership of the domain, and install the certificate on NGINX (or other web servers).

**Supported distributions:** RHEL 7 and CentOS 7

## Before You Begin

Before continuing with this guide, you need a website accessible over HTTP using your desired domain name. Breaking this down further, the following components are required:

1.  **A server running on CentOS 7 or RHEL 7** with credentials to a standard user account (belonging to the `sudo` group) and the ability to access the server through[SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/guides/lish/). [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/) and [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guides for information on deploying and configuring a Linode Compute Instance.

2.  **A registered domain name with DNS records pointing to the IPv4 (and optionally IPv6) address of your server.** A domain can be obtained through any registrar and can utilize any DNS service, such as Linode's [DNS Manager](/docs/products/networking/dns-manager/). Review the [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/guides/dns-overview/) guide for more information on configuring DNS.

3.  **The NGINX web server software installed on your server and configured for your domain.** You can review the [Install a LEMP Stack on CentOS 7](/docs/guides/lemp-stack-on-centos-7-with-fastcgi/) guide for information on installing and configuring NGINX.
