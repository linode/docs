The [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) utility automates all processes involved in obtaining and installing a TLS/SSL certificate. It works directly with the free [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority to request (or renew) a certificate, prove ownership of the domain, and install the certificate on Apache, NGINX, or other web servers. This allows Certbot to dramatically reduce the effort (and cost) of securing your websites with HTTPS.

The following tutorials outline how to install and use Certbot with either Apache or NGINX on various Linux distributions.
