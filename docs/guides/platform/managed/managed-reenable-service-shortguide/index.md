To reenable monitoring for a service:

1.  Log into the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

1.  Click the **Managed** link in the sidebar.

1.  Select the **Monitors** tab. A table which lists your monitored services will appear below the tab.

1.  Find the service that you want to temporarily disable and click on the corresponding **more options ellipsis**. Select the **Enable** option from the menu that appears.

Linode Managed is now monitoring the service again. The service will be checked in a few minutes--if it's available, the dashboard will then indicate that the service's status is **Verified**.
