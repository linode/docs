You can make any of your Account StackScripts public. When an account StackScript is public it becomes available to the rest of the Linode Community in the Cloud Manager as a Community StackScript.

{{< caution >}}
Once you make an Account StackScript public, you will not be able to make it private again or to delete it. You can, however, edit your public StackScript, if needed.
{{</ caution >}}

1. Log into the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/).

1. Click on the **StackScripts** link in the left-hand navigation menu. You are brought to the *StackScripts* page.

1.  A list of all of your account's StackScripts appears under the **Account StackScripts** tab. This includes both private and public StackScripts. Click on the **more options ellipsis** corresponding to the StackScript you'd like to make public and select **Make StackScript Public** from the dropdown menu.

    A dialog box appears asking you to confirm the action. Click on **Yes, make me a star!** if you would like to proceed. You are brought back to the Account StackScripts page.

    {{< note >}}
Your public [Account StackScript](/docs/platform/stackscripts/how-to-deploy-a-new-linode-using-a-stackscript/#account-stackscripts) is available to you for use on the Account StackScripts page. For Linode Community members, your StackScript is available to them from the [Community StackScripts](/docs/platform/stackscripts/how-to-deploy-a-new-linode-using-a-stackscript/#community-stackscripts) page.
