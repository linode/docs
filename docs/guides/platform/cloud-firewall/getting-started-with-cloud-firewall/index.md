## What is Linode Cloud Firewall?

{{< note >}}
Cloud Firewall is now in beta, sign up through the [Linode Green Light program](https://www.linode.com/green-light/#sign-up-form) to test this feature before it's generally available. For more information visit the [Cloud Firewall](https://www.linode.com/products/firewall/) product page.
{{</ note >}}

Linode Cloud Firewall is a free service used to create, configure, and add stateful network-based firewalls to Linode services using the Linode Cloud Manager and the [Linode APIv4](/docs/api/). A Cloud Firewall is independent of the service it is attached to, so you can apply a single Firewall to multiple Linode services.

### Features

A Cloud Firewall analyzes traffic against a set of predefined rules at the network layer and determines if the traffic is permitted to communicate to or from the Linode Service it secures. Cloud Firewalls can be configured with an implicit deny or allow rule-- they can block or allow all traffic by default and only pass through or deny network traffic that meets the parameters of the configured rules.

### Limitations

- Currently, a Cloud Firewall can only be applied to Linodes.
- You can apply one Cloud Firewall per Linode service.

### Inbound and Outbound Rules

A Cloud Firewall can be configured with *Inbound* and *Outbound* rules. Inbound rules limit incoming network connections to a Linode service based on the port(s) and sources you configure. Outbound rules limit the outgoing network connections coming from a Linode service based on the port(s) and destinations you configure.

### Predefined Rules

The Linode Cloud Manager provides a list of *predefined rules* that you can add to your Cloud Firewall. The predefined rules support common networking use cases and provide an easy foundation to get started with Cloud Firewalls. Since you can edit any rule applied to a Cloud Firewall you can use the predefined rules as a foundation and further [edit their configurations](/docs/products/networking/cloud-firewall/guides/edit-rules/)and also [add new custom rules](/docs/products/networking/cloud-firewall/guides/add-rules/) to your Firewall.

## Configure Cloud Firewall Rules

Upon initial creation of a Cloud Firewall, you are required to select Firewall rules from a predefined list that supports common networking use cases. This section shows you how to add new Firewall rules to your Firewall's existing rules, edit your Firewall's predefined rules, and delete Firewall rules.
