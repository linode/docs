1. Log into your [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) and select **Firewalls** from the navigation menu.

1. From the **Firewalls** listing page, click on the Firewall that you would like to add new rules to. This takes you to the Firewall's **Rules** page.

1. On the **Rules** page, select the default behavior for both inbound and outbound traffic using the **Inbound Policy** and **Outbound Policy** dropdown menus. **Accept** will allow all traffic except for those defined in the listed rules, and **Drop** will drop or deny all traffic except for those defined in the rules.

1. Click on the **Add an Inbound/Outbound Rule** link (click on the appropriate link for the type of Rule you would like to add).

    ![Click on the Add an Inbound/Outbound Rule link.](add-a-new-firewall-rule.png "Click on the Add an Inbound/Outbound Rule link.")

    The **Add an Inbound/Outbound Rule** drawer appears.

1. Provide the following Rule configurations:

    | **Configuration** | **Description** |
    | --------------- | --------------- |
    | **Preset** | &bull; Select from a list of optional predefined Firewall rules. Selecting a predefined rule fills in the remaining Rule configuration values, however, they can all be edited. *Optional*|
    | **Label** | &bull; A label for the rule being created. This is used only as an identifier for the Linode Account holder, and does not have any impact on firewall performance. *Optional*
    | **Description** | &bull; A Description of the rule being created. This is used only as an identifier for the Linode Account holder, and does not have any impact on firewall performance. *Optional*|
    | **Protocol** | Select the Transport Layer protocol to use for this Firewall rule. *Required*|
    | **Ports** | &bull; Select from a list of common port numbers, or select **Custom** to open the **Custom Port Range** configuration option. More than one option may be selected. *Required*|
    | **Custom Port Range**| &bull; Provide a port number or a range of ports on which to allow network traffic. To configure a **Port Range** provide the starting and ending port numbers. For example, `2000-3000`.  *Optional*|
    | **Sources / Destinations**| &bull; When creating an **Inbound Rule**, select from a list of **Sources** that limit incoming connections to the chosen internet protocol, netmask, or specific IP address(es).<br><br> &bull; When creating an **Outbound Rule**, select from a list of **Destinations** that limit the outgoing connections to the chosen internet protocol, netmask, or specific IP address(es). *Required*|
    | **Action** | &bull; Choose whether this rule will be to allow or drop traffic. The action defined in specific rules will take precedence over the default inbound and outbound traffic policy. *Required* |

1. Click on **Add Rule** to add the new rule to this Firewall. If you would like to add any additional rules, repeat the process outlined in this section.

    ![Click on Add Rule to add the new rule to this Firewall.](add-your-new-rule.png "Click on Add Rule to add the new rule to this Firewall.")

1. When you are done adding new Firewall rules, review them on the **Rules** page you are redirected to by default. Firewall rules are applied in order from top to bottom as they appear on this page. If you would like to re-order these rules, drag and drop any row into their desired position.

1. When you are done reviewing the new Firewall rules, click on the **Save Changes** button on the **Rules** page.

    {{< note >}}
Any newly added rules do not take effect until you **Save Changes** to the Firewall.
