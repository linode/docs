You can find your Linode's disks in the **Disks/Configs** tab of the Linode's detail page.

1.  Click the **Linodes** link in the sidebar menu and select the Linode whose disks you'd like to see.

1.  Then click the **Disks/Configs** tab. The disks are located in the **Disks** panel. Here you can [add a disk](/docs/platform/disk-images/disk-images-and-configuration-profiles/#disks), or for each individual disk, you can click the **more options ellipses** to get a drop down menu which will allow you to choose options such as `Rename`, `Resize`, `Imagize`, `Clone`, and `Delete`.
