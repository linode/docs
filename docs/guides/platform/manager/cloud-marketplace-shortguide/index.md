The **Marketplace** section of Cloud Manager gives you access to apps that make it easy to deploy and configure Marketplace Apps on a Linode. Some popular Marketplace Apps are [WordPress](/docs/platform/marketplace/deploying-wordpress-with-marketplace-apps/), [Minecraft](/docs/platform/marketplace/deploying-minecraft-with-marketplace-apps/), and [GitLab](/docs/platform/marketplace/deploy-gitlab-with-marketplace-apps/). We are actively adding new and useful Marketplace apps. When a Marketplace App is deployed, a new Linode is created and the appropriate software is installed with the configurations you provide.

See [How to Use Linode's Marketplace Apps](/docs/platform/marketplace/how-to-use-marketplace-apps-at-linode/) to get started using Marketplace Apps in Cloud Manager.
