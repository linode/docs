The **Object Storage** section of Cloud Manager gives you access to Linode’s [Object Storage service](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/) which is a globally-available, S3-compatible method for storing and accessing data.

To learn how to begin using Object Storage, view our [How to Use Linode Object Storage](/docs/platform/object-storage/how-to-use-object-storage/) guide. To access all available Object Storage guides, see the [Object Storage section](/docs/platform/object-storage/) of our documentation site.
