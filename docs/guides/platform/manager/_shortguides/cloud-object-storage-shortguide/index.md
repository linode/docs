The **Object Storage** section of Cloud Manager gives you access to Linode’s [Object Storage service](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/) which is a globally-available, S3-compatible method for storing and accessing data.

To learn how to use Object Storage, view the [Get Started with Object Storage](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/get-started/) guide or take a look through all the [Object Storage guides](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/).
