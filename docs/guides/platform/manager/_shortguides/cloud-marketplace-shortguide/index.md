The **Marketplace** section of Cloud Manager gives you access to apps that make it easy to deploy and configure Marketplace Apps on a Linode. Some popular Marketplace Apps are [WordPress](/docs/products/tools/marketplace/guides/wordpress/), [Minecraft](/docs/products/tools/marketplace/guides/minecraft/), and [GitLab](/docs/products/tools/marketplace/guides/gitlab/). We are actively adding new and useful Marketplace apps. When a Marketplace App is deployed, a new Linode is created and the appropriate software is installed with the configurations you provide.

See [How to Use Linode's Marketplace Apps](/docs/products/tools/marketplace/get-started/) to get started using Marketplace Apps in Cloud Manager.
