[StackScripts](https://www.linode.com/stackscripts/) provide Linode users with the ability to automate the deployment of custom systems on top of our default Linux distribution images. StackScripts are usually Bash scripts, stored in the Linode Cloud Manager, and can be accessed when you deploy a Linode. Linodes deployed with a StackScript run the script as part of the first boot process.

To get started using StackScripts in Cloud Manager, see the [Automate Deployment with StackScripts](/docs/products/tools/stackscripts/) guide.
