The Linodes section of Cloud Manager allows you to create and manage your Linodes. Each Linode instance in Cloud Manager includes:

- [Summary information](/docs/guides/monitor-and-maintain-compute-instance/#linode-cloud-manager) about your Linode, like CPU usage, IPv4 and [IPv6 traffic](/docs/guides/an-overview-of-ipv6-on-linode/), and Disk IO
- Access to any of your Linode's attached Volumes and the ability to [create a Volume](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/guides/manage-volumes/)
- Networking information and features, including the ability to add IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, [IP transfer](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#transferring-ip-addresses) and [IP sharing](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#configuring-ip-sharing)
- The ability to [resize your Linode](/docs/guides/resizing-a-linode/), boot your Linode into [Rescue Mode](/docs/guides/rescue-and-rebuild/#rescue-mode-overview), and [rebuild your Linode](/docs/guides/rescue-and-rebuild/#rebuilding)
- Access to Linode's [Backup service](/docs/products/storage/backups/#enable-the-backup-service)
- An [Activity Feed](/docs/guides/cloud-manager-events-and-activity-feeds/#viewing-a-linodes-activity-feed) that displays any relevant events related to this Linode
- Settings that allow you to update your Linode's label, [reset your Linode's root password](/docs/guides/reset-the-root-password-on-your-linode/), [manage system usage email notifications](/docs/guides/monitor-and-maintain-compute-instance/#configure-linode-cloud-manager-email-alerts), [manage Watchdog](/docs/guides/monitor-and-maintain-compute-instance/#configure-shutdown-watchdog) (Linode's automatic reboot feature), and delete your Linode
- Areas to [manage disks](/docs/guides/disks-and-storage/) and [manage configuration profiles](/docs/guides/linode-configuration-profiles/)
