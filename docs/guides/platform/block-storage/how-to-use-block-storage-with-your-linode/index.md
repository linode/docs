Linodeâ€™s Block Storage service allows you to attach additional storage drives (called *Volumes*) to your Linode. A single Volume can range from 10 GiB to 10,000 GiB in size and costs $0.10/GiB per month. Each Volume be partitioned however you like and can accommodate any file system type you choose. Additional pricing details as well as availability, features, and limitations can be found on the [Block Storage Overview](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/) product guide.

## How to Add a Block Storage Volume to a Linode

This guide assumes a Linode with the root disk mounted as `/dev/sda` and swap space mounted as `/dev/sdb`. In this scenario, the Block Storage Volume will be available to the operating system as `/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_EXAMPLE`, where `EXAMPLE` is a label you assign the Volume in the Linode Cloud Manager. Storage Volumes can be added when your Linode is already running, and will show immediately in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.

{{< note >}}
A Linode can have multiple Block Storage Volumes attached to it. However, a Block Storage Volume can only be attached to one Linode at a time.
