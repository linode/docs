**Software installation should complete within 2-5 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/). That said, some options may be limited or recommended based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** Debian 10, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Peppermint App

After Peppermint has finished installing, you can access your Peppermint server with your Linode's IPv4 address. Copy your Linodeâ€™s IPv4 address from the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com), and then connect to the server in your browser using your Linode's IPv4 address and port `5001`(for example `192.0.2.0:5001`).
