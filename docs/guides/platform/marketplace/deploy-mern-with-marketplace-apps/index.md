## MERN Marketplace App

A MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack is a free and open-source web software bundle used to build modern web applications:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document database used to persist your application's data.

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) serves as the web application framework.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is used to build your application's user interfaces using JavaScript. React offers a server-side rendering function which makes it easier for search engines to crawl your web application.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) serves as the run-time environment for your application.

All of these technologies are well-established, offer robust feature sets, and are well-supported by their maintaining organizations. These characteristics make them a great choice for your applications. Upload your existing MERN website code to your new Linode, or use MERN's scaffolding tool to start writing new web applications on the Linode.

### Deploy a MERN Marketplace App

{{< content deploy-marketplace-apps>}}

### MERN Options

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MongoDB Admin Password** | The administrative password for your MongoDB database. *Required*. |

### Linode Options

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 9 is currently the only image supported by the MERN Marketplace App, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/guides/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/guides/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/guides/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). The Linode plan you deploy your MERN stack on should account for the estimated workload. If you are standing up a simple web page, you can use a 1GB Linode (Nanode) or 2GB Linode. If you deploy a more robust web app, then consider a plan with higher RAM and CPU allocations. If you decide that you need more or fewer hardware resources after you deploy your app, you can always [resize your Linode](/docs/guides/resizing-a-linode/) to a different plan. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name is how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |


### Getting Started After Deployment

After your MERN One-click App has finished installing, you can:

- [Connect to your Linode via SSH](/docs/guides/getting-started/#connect-to-your-linode-via-ssh). You need your Linode's root password to proceed.

- Consult the following guides to learn more about working with the various components of the MERN stack:

    - [Build Database Clusters with MongoDB](/docs/guides/build-database-clusters-with-mongodb/)
    - [Deploy a React Application on Linode](/docs/guides/deploy-a-react-app-on-linode/)


### Software Included

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MongoDB** | Document-based database |
| **Express** | Web application framework |
| **React** | JavaScript library |
| **Node JS** | Runtime environment |
| **UFW (UncomplicatedFirewall)** | Firewall utility. Ports 22/tcp for IPv4 and IPv6 allows incoming traffic. All other ports have the following firewall rules: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing). |
