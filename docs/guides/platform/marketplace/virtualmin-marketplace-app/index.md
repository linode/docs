[Virtualmin](https://www.virtualmin.com) is an open source control panel for web hosting management. It offers an easy to use graphical interface for managing websites, email, and databases. It's built on top of and integrated with the popular Webmin.

## Deploying the Virtualmin Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

**Software installation should complete within 2-5 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

### Virtualmin Options

The Virtualmin Marketplace form includes advanced fields to setup your Virtualmin server's limited user account and DNS records. These are optional configurations and are not required for installation.

| **Field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **The limited sudo user to be created for the Linode** | This is the limited user account to be created for the Linode. This account will have sudo user privileges. |
| **The password for the limited sudo user** | Set a password for the limited sudo user. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. This password can be used to perform any action on your server, similar to root, so make it long, complex, and unique. |
| **The SSH Public Key that will be used to access the Linode** | If you wish to access [SSH via Public Key](https://www.linode.com/docs/security/authentication/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) (recommended) rather than by password, enter the public key here. |
| **Enable passwordless sudo access for the limited user?** | If you entered an SSH Public Key above and it is for the limited user account, select `Yes`, this will allow SSH to use Public Key login for the limited user. Select `No` if you want SSH to rely on using password login for the limited user account. |
| **Disable root access over SSH?** | Select `Yes` to block the root account from logging into the server via SSH. Select `No` to allow the root account to login via SSH. |
| **Your Linode API Token** | Your Linode `API Token` is needed to create DNS records. If this is provided along with the `subdomain` and `domain` fields, the installation will attempt to create DNS records via the Linode API. If you don't have a token, but you want the installation to create DNS records, you must [create one](/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token) before continuing. |
| **Subdomain** | The subdomain you wish the installer to create a DNS record for during setup. The suggestion given is `www`. The subdomain should only be provided if you also provide a `domain` and `API Token`. |
| **Domain** | The domain name where you wish to host your Virtualmin server. The installer creates a DNS record for this domain during setup if you provide this field along with your `API Token`. |
| **Admin Email for the server** | The start of authority (SOA) email address for this server. This email address will be added to the SOA record for the domain. This is a required field if you want the installer to create DNS records. |
| **Do you need an MX record for this domain?** | Check `yes` if you plan on using Virtualmin to setup email. The installer, along with your `API Token` (required) will setup the necessary MX records in the DNS Manager. Select `no` if you do not plan on using Virtualmin to manage email. You can [add an MX record manually](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/#mx) at a later time if you change your decision. |
| **Do you need an SPF record for this domain?** | Check `yes` if you plan on using Virtualmin to setup email. The installer, along with your `API Token` (required) will setup the necessary SPF records in the DNS Manager. Select `no` if you do not plan on using Virtualmin to manage email. You can [add an SPF record manually](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/#spf) at a later time if you change your decision. |

### General Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Getting Started > Create a Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/#create-a-linode). That said, some options may be limited or recommended based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** Debian 10
- **Recommended minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

## Getting Started after Deployment

Virtualmin is now installed and ready to use.

1.  Before you go to our app, if you filled out the optional Virtualmin configuration fields:

    - In the Cloud Manager [DNS Manager](/docs/guides/dns-manager/#add-a-domain) there is now an entry for your domain with possible subdomain, MX, and SPF records pointing to your new server.
    - [Configure the rDNS](/docs/networking/dns/configure-your-linode-for-reverse-dns/) on your Linode.

1.  Virtualmin is served on port 10000, to access it, navigate to either the IP address of your server or to your domain name followed by port 10000. For example, `http://example.com:10000` or `http://203.0.113.0:10000`, replacing the domain name or IP address with values for your server.

    ![Virtualmin Login Screen](virtualmin-login-screen.png "Virtualmin Login Screen")

1.  At the login screen, login using either:

    - The system root username and password
    - The sudo username and password if you set that up in the Virtualmin optional configuration during installation.

1.  After logging in for the first time, a Post-Installation Wizard walks you through some initial setup to optimize your system. If you choose `Cancel` the wizard will use the default settings.

1.  On the main dashboard, Virtualmin must check its configuration before virtual servers can be added. Click the **Re-check and refresh configuration** button.

    ![Virtualmin Check Configuration](virtualmin-check-config.png "Virtualmin Check Configuration")

1.  Virtualmin checks your system and returns a list of statuses and recommendations that you can choose to take action on if desired.

1.  Click the **Return to virtual servers list** button at the bottom of the screen when you are finished. You are now ready to start administering your server.
