MagicSpam is a powerful anti-spam and email security solution for Linux systems. It integrates directly with popular control panels, such as cPanel and Plesk. It's primary function is to stop inbound spam from entering your server right at the SMTP layer, which lowers bandwidth and overhead. It also secure mailboxes on your server from being compromised and used to send outbound spam.

MagicSpam installs directly onto an email server without any need to change A/MX records to protect unlimited users and domains. MagicSpam also integrates natively into many control panel interfaces and comes equipped with log and statistic modules to help with the management of an email server.

{{< note >}}
In an effort to fight spam, Linode restricts outbound connections on ports 25, 465, and 587 on all Linodes for new accounts created after November 5th, 2019. For more information, please see [Sending Email on Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/email/running-a-mail-server/#sending-email-on-linode).
{{</ note >}}

As MagicSpam is designed to integrate and run alongside with Control Panels, the MagicSpam App also deploys the selected control panel (cPanel or Plesk). Both of these control panels may require purchasing a license. Additionally, a MagicSpam license key is required to deploy MagicSpam on Linode, which you can purchase through the [MagicSpam Store](https://www.magicspam.com/store.php).

If you want to deploy MagicSpam onto an existing Linode Compute Instance, do not follow this guide. Instead, install MagicSpam by following one of the below guides:

* [MagicSpam for cPanel Installation Guide](https://www.magicspam.com/download/products/MSWHMC/InstallationGuide.pdf)
* [MagicSpam for Plesk Installation Guide](https://www.magicspam.com/download/products/MSPPRO/InstallationGuide.pdf)
