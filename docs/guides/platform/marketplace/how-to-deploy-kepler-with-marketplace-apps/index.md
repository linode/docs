{{< content deploy-one-click-apps >}}

### Kepler Options

You can configure your WordPress App by providing values for the following fields:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **E-Mail Address** | E-Mail address for your WordPress admin user. This is also used as the start of authority (SOA) email address for this server. This email address is added to the SOA record for the domain. This is a required field if you want the installer to create DNS records. *Required*. |
| **Admin Username** | Username for your WordPress admin user. *Required*. |
| **Admin Password** | Password for your WordPress admin user. *Required*. |
| **MySQL root Password** | The root password for your MySQL database. *Required*. |
| **WordPress Database Password** | The root password for your WordPress database. *Required*. |
| **Website Title** | Your WordPress site's title. |
| **The limited sudo user to be created for the Linode** | This is the limited user account to be created for the Linode. This account has sudo user privileges. |
| **The password for the limited sudo user** | Set a password for the limited sudo user. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. This password can be used to perform any action on your server, similar to root, so make it long, complex, and unique. |
| **The SSH Public Key that will be used to access the Linode** | If you wish to access [SSH via Public Key](/docs/security/authentication/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) (recommended) rather than by password, enter the public key here. |
| **Enable passwordless sudo access for the limited user?** | If you entered an SSH Public Key above and it is for the limited user account, select `Yes`, this allows SSH to use Public Key login for the limited user. Select `No` if you want SSH to rely on using password login for the limited user account. |
| **Disable root access over SSH?** | Select `Yes` to block the root account from logging into the server via SSH. Select `No` to allow the root account to login via SSH. |
| **Configure automatic security updates** | Select `Yes` to have the system automatically update WordPress with the latest security updates. Select `No` to if you wish to manage all updates manually. |
| **Use fail2ban to prevent automated intrusion attemps?** | Select `Yes` to install fail2ban. Select `No` to not install fail2ban during installation. You [can install this at a later time](/docs/security/basics/using-fail2ban-to-secure-your-server-a-tutorial/). |
| **Your Linode API Token** | Your Linode `API Token` is needed to create DNS records. If this is provided along with the `subdomain` and `domain` fields, the installation attempts to create DNS records via the Linode API. If you don't have a token, but you want the installation to create DNS records, you must [create one](/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token) before continuing. |
| **Subdomain** | The subdomain you wish the installer to create a DNS record for during setup. The suggestion given is `www`. The subdomain should only be provided if you also provide a `domain` and `API Token`. |
| **Domain** | The domain name where you wish to host your WordPress site. The installer creates a DNS record for this domain during setup if you provide this field along with your `API Token`. |
| **Do you need an MX record for this domain?** | Check `Yes` if you plan on using WordPress to send email. The installer, along with your `API Token` (required) sets up the necessary MX records in the DNS Manager. Select `No` if you do not plan on using WordPress to send email. You can [add an MX record manually](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/#mx) at a later time if you change your decision. |
| **Do you need an SPF record for this domain?** | Check `yes` if you plan on using WordPress to send email. The installer, along with your `API Token` (required) sets up the necessary SPF records in the DNS Manager. Select `No` if you do not plan on using WordPress to send email. You can [add an SPF record manually](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/#spf) at a later time if you change your decision. |
| **Would you like to use a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate?** | Select `Yes` if you would like the install to create an SSL certificate for you, or `No` if you do not. You cannot create secure, encrypted conferences without an SSL certificate. |

### Linode Options

After providing the app specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Select an Image** | Debian 10 is currently the only image supported by WordPress Marketplace Apps, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required*. |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). WordPress is an extremely flexible CMS that can be supported on any size Linode, but we suggest you build your WordPress app on a Linode plan that reflects how much content you plan on featuring and how much traffic you expect on your site. For small websites, a 1GB Linode (Nanode) is sufficient. If you decide that you need more or fewer hardware resources after you deploy your app, you can always [resize your Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/) to a different plan. *Required*. |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name is how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required*. |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your Kepler app will complete installation anywhere between 2-5 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.

## Getting Started After Deployment

### Access Your WordPress Site

After Kepler has finished installing, you can access your WordPress site by copying your Linode's IPv4 address and entering it in the browser of your choice. If you've set up DNS during installation, you can go to your domain name in the browser. To find your Linode's IPv4 address:

1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the sidebar to see a list of all your Linodes.

1. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

1. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

1. Your IPv4 address is listed under the **Address** column in the **IPv4** table.

1. Copy and paste the IPv4 address into a browser window. You should see your WordPress site's home page.

### Software Included

The WordPress Marketplace App installs the following required software on your Linode:

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| [**MySQL Server**](https://www.mysql.com/) | Relational database. |
| [**PHP 7**](https://www.php.net/) | WordPress is written in PHP and requires PHP to operate. |
| [**Apache HTTP Server**](https://httpd.apache.org/) | Web server used to serve the WordPress site. |
| [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.org/) | Content management system. |
| [**WP CLI**](https://wp-cli.org/) | The command line interface for WordPress. |
