WarpSpeed makes it easy for developers to access cloud infrastructure via the powerful WireGuard® VPN protocol. It can also be used to enable remote workers to access the internet securely while on public WiFi.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the WarpSpeed VPN App

1.  Configure your custom domain to point towards the IPv4 (and IPv6) address of the newly created Compute Instance. Review the [DNS Manager](/docs/guides/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on setting up your DNS records in the Cloud Manager and read through [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/guides/dns-records-an-introduction/) for general information about how DNS works.

1.  Once your domain has been configured and has finished propagating, enter the domain within a web browser to access the login page.

1.  Enter the *Admin Email* and *Admin Password* you defined during the initial deployment of this Compute Instance.

Now that you’ve accessed your WarpSpeed VPN instance, check out [the official WarpSpeed VPN documentation](https://bunker.services/products/warpspeed/install-linode) to learn how to further configure your WarpSpeed VPN instance.
