## Discourse Marketplace App

[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is an open source discussion platform that provides a forum, mailing list, chat room, and more.

## Before You Begin

Discourse requires that you have a domain name and access to a personal SMTP email server before installation.  This requires either having access to a pre-existing SMTP server, or setting up an [SMTP Relay](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/387/does-linode-offer-an-smtp-relay-service) through a third party. The Discourse Marketplace App will **require** an SMTP username and password for a server under your control in order to successfully complete the installation.

  - If you don't already have your domain hosted at Linode, the install creates A and AAAA domain records for you.

    - This means you need a Linode API token. If you don't have a token, you must [create one](/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token) before continuing.

    - Ensure that your domain registrar is [using Linode's name servers](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/#use-linodes-name-servers-with-your-domain).

  - Additionally, the SMTP user must be able to send email from `noreply@your-domain.com` for administrator account verification.

    - For example, if you enter a subdomain of `discourse` and your domain name is `example.com`, then the SMTP user must be able to send email from `noreply@discourse.example.com`.

    - You are not required to use a subdomain. Therefore, if you only setup `example.com` with no subdomain, the email used for verification would be `noreply@example.com`.


## Deploy Discourse with Marketplace Apps

{{< content deploy-one-click-apps >}}

### Discourse Options

The Discourse Marketplace form includes advanced fields to setup your Discourse server's A and AAAA domain records and a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. Some of these fields are optional configurations and are not required for installation. The fields that are required are marked *Required*.

{{< note >}}
Discourse requires that you have a domain name and SMTP email. These fields are required for a successful installation and are marked *Required*. Additionally, the SMTP user must be able to send email from `noreply@your-fully-qualified-domain.com` for account verification.
{{</ note >}}

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Your Linode API Token** | Your Linode API access token is needed to create your DNS records and to create the Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. If you don't have a token, you must [create one](/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token) before continuing. *Required* |
| **Subdomain** | The subdomain you wish the installer to create a DNS record for during setup. |
| **Domain** | The domain name where you wish to host your Discourse app. The installer creates a DNS record for this domain during setup. *Required* |
| **Email for Admin Account and Let's Encrypt certificate** | The email you wish to use for the administrator account and the SSL certificate. This email address receives notifications when the certificate needs to be renewed. *Required* |
| **SMTP Address** | The address for SMTP. Discourse uses this for sending email. *Required* |
| **SMTP Username** | The username for the SMTP account entered above. The SMTP user must be able to send email from `noreply@your-fully-qualified-domain.com` for account verification. *Required* |
| **Password for SMTP User** | The password for the SMTP account listed above. *Required* |
| **The limited sudo user to be created for the Linode** | This is the limited user account to be created for the Linode. This account has sudo user privileges. |
| **The password for the limited sudo user** | Set a password for the limited sudo user. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. This password can be used to perform any action on your server, similar to root, so make it long, complex, and unique. |
| **The SSH Public Key that will be used to access the Linode** | If you wish to access [SSH via Public Key](/docs/security/authentication/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) (recommended) rather than by password, enter the public key here. |
| **Disable root access over SSH?** | Select `Yes` to block the root account from logging into the server via SSH. Select `No` to allow the root account to login via SSH. |

### Linode Options

After providing the app-specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Select an Image** | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is currently the only image supported by the Discourse Marketplace App, and it is pre-selected on the Linode creation page. *Required* |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required* |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). The Linode plan that you select should be appropriate for the amount of data transfer, users, and other stress that may affect the performance of your server. Discourse recommends a minimum of 1GB of RAM, 2GB of swap, and 10GB of storage space. However, 4GB of RAM is recommended. *Required* |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name is how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required* |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required* |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your Discourse app will complete installation anywhere between 15-20 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.

## Getting Started After Deployment

Discourse is now installed and ready to use.

1.  Your A and AAAA Domain records for the domain and subdomain, if you designated one, have been created and you should see them in the Cloud Manager.

    - In the Cloud Manager [DNS Manager](/docs/guides/dns-manager/#add-a-domain), confirm that there are now an entries for your domain and possible subdomain.
    - [Configure rDNS](/docs/guides/configure-your-linode-for-reverse-dns/) on your Linode to point to `subdomain.your-domain.com` or `your-domain.com` if you did not enter a subdomain.

1.  While the installation has created the A and AAAA domain records, it does not create the email records you need. In the Cloud Manager DNS Manager, [add the MX, TXT, and any other records](/docs/guides/dns-manager/#add-dns-records) required to send email as specified by your email provider.

1.  You can now navigate to the Discourse app in your browser with the fully qualified domain name you entered during configuration, `https://subdomain.your-domain.com` or `https://your-domain.com`.

1.  Discourse welcomes you with a "Congratulations" screen and a **Register** button. Click the **Register** button to create the administrator account.

1.  On the Register Admin Account page, select one of the email addresses you entered during installation and enter a Username and Password. Then click the **Register** button.

    ![Discourse Register Admin Account Page](discourse-register-admin-account.png "Discourse Register Admin Account Page")

1.  Discourse sends a confirmation email for account verification from your SMTP server. After you receive the email and confirm, you are redirected to the welcome screen where you are walked through a wizard to setup your Discourse.

## Troubleshooting Email

If you did not get a confirmation email during setup it could be caused by several issues.

### Check DNS Records
Ensure that you have correctly setup the [email DNS records](/docs/guides/dns-manager/#add-dns-records) required to send email as specified from your email provider. The Installer does not do this for you as every email host has different required records and values.

### Change the Confirmation Email Sender
Discourse sends this email from `noreply@subdomain.your-domain.com`. The SMTP user you entered during setup must have permissions to send from this address. If this is not the case, and you did not receive the email, you can change this address in a configuration file.

1.  [Connect to your Marketplace App's Linode via SSH](/docs/getting-started/#connect-to-your-linode-via-ssh).

1.  Change into the directory `/var/discourse/containers/`:

        cd /var/discourse/containers

1.  Edit the file `app.yml` with the text editor of your choice. Uncomment the following line and edit the email address to the email you wish to send the confirmation email from. The SMTP user must have permissions to send email from this address.

    {{< file "/var/discourse/containers/app.yml" >}}
...

## If you want to set the 'From' email address for your first registration, uncomment and change:
- exec: rails r "SiteSetting.notification_email='noreply@example.com'"
## After getting the first signup email, re-comment the line. It only needs to run once.

...
{{</ file >}}

1.  Save the file and exit.

1.  Change directory into `/var/discourse` and rebuild Discourse.

        cd ..
        ./launcher rebuild app

1.  Once Discourse has finished rebuilding, return to the confirmation email page in the browser and try again.
