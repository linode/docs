## OpenLiteSpeed Marketplace App

[OpenLiteSpeed](https://openlitespeed.org/) is the Open Source edition of LiteSpeed cache for WordPress plugin that provides accelerated hosting platform for WordPress. OpenLiteSpeed combines speed, security, scalability, optimization and simplicity in one friendly open-source package.

## Before you begin

You need a registered domain name to assign it the Linode server.

## Deploy OpenLiteSpeed with Marketplace Apps

{{< content deploy-marketplace-apps >}}

### Linode Options

After providing the app-specific options, provide configurations for your Linode server:

| **Configuration** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Select an Image** | CentOS 7 and 8, Debian 10, and Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 are currently the only images supported by the OpenLiteSpeed Marketplace App. *Required* |
| **Region** | The region where you would like your Linode to reside. In general, it's best to choose a location that's closest to you. For more information on choosing a DC, review the [How to Choose a Data Center](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-data-center) guide. You can also generate [MTR reports](/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/) for a deeper look at the network routes between you and each of our data centers. *Required*. |
| **Linode Plan** | Your Linode's [hardware resources](/docs/platform/how-to-choose-a-linode-plan/#hardware-resource-definitions). You can use any size Linode for your OpenLiteSpeed plugin. The Linode plan that you select should be appropriate for the amount of data transfer, users, storage, and other stress that may affect the performance of server.  *Required* |
| **Linode Label** | The name for your Linode, which must be unique between all of the Linodes on your account. This name will be how you identify your server in the Cloud Managerâ€™s Dashboard. *Required*. |
| **Root Password** | The primary administrative password for your Linode instance. This password must be provided when you log in to your Linode via SSH. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. Your root password can be used to perform any action on your server, so make it long, complex, and unique. *Required* |

When you've provided all required Linode Options, click on the **Create** button. **Your OpenLiteSpeed plugin will complete installation anywhere between 2-5 minutes after your Linode has finished provisioning**.

## Getting Started After Deployment

1. Find your Linode's IPv4 address:

    1. Click on the **Linodes** link in the sidebar to see a list of all your Linodes.

    1. Find the Linode you just created when deploying your app and select it.

    1. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.

    1. Your IPv4 address is listed under the **Address** column in the **IPv4** table.

1. Add a domain name to the server. You can assign it (or a subdomain) to your WordPress site. Specifically, you need to set up an [*A record*](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/#a-and-aaaa) that's associated with your Linode's IP address. To learn how to set up DNS records in the Cloud Manager, review the [DNS Manager](/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/) guide. For more general information about how DNS works, review the [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/networking/dns/dns-records-an-introduction/) guide.

1. From a terminal on your local computer, connect to the server as root:

        ssh root@ipaddress

    An output similar to the following appears:
        {{< output >}}
Linux localhost 4.19.0-13-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.160-2 (2020-11-28) x86_64
