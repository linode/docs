Zabbix is an enterprise-class, open source, distributed monitoring solution. Designed as an all-in-one monitoring solution, Zabbix can track performance and availability of network servers, devices, services, and other IT resources.

Zabbix empowers administrators to quickly respond to incidents with on-screen display capabilities and alerts by e-mail, SMS, or Jabber. Users can also collect, store, manage, and analyze information received from IT infrastructure.

Actively used by SMBs and large enterprises across all industries and in almost every country, Zabbix has a robust community driving its continued development.

## Deploying the Zabbix Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

**Software installation should complete within 5-10 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

### Zabbix Options

You can configure your Zabbix App by providing values for the following fields:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Hostname** | Your Zabbix Linode's hostname. *Required*. |

### General Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Getting Started > Create a Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/#create-a-linode). That said, some options may be limited or recommended based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** CentOS 7
- **Recommended minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Zabbix App

After Zabbix has finished installing, you must first access your Zabbix Linode from the console via [SSH](/docs/guides/getting-started/#connect-to-your-linode-via-ssh), to obtain a randomly-generated administrative password. You can then use this password to log into your Zabbix App via web browser at your Linode's [IPv4 address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/).

1. From your terminal, log into your Zabbix Linode as the `root` user with the following command, replacing `192.0.2.0` with your Linode's [IPv4 address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/):

        ssh root@192.0.2.0

1. The Zabbix welome banner appears immediately after logging into your Zabbix Linode. Copy and save the randomly generated Admin password from the welcome banner in a secure manner for later. Here is an example welcome banner:

********************************************************************************
Zabbix frontend credentials:
Username: Admin
Password: abcdef0123456789

Note! Do not forget to change timezone PHP variable in /etc/php.d/99-zabbix.ini file.
********************************************************************************
    {{< /output >}}

1. Enter your Zabbix Linode's [IPv4 address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/) into a browser window to access your Zabbix App's login page.

    {{< note >}}
Zabbix uses a self-signed certificate. Because it is not signed by a common Certificate Authority, your browser may warn you about the security of the connection and require you to add a security exception.
    {{</ note >}}

1. Enter `Admin` as the username and the Admin password you saved from the welcome banner, then click **Sign in** to access the Zabbix control panel.
