Valheim is an open-world Viking-themed survival and sandbox game developed by [Iron Gate Studio](https://irongatestudio.se/). Play solo in single player mode, or invite your friends for player vs. environment multiplayer mode. With challenging combat, numerous boss battles, and a creative building system that lets you craft things like halls, forts, and even imposing Viking warships, there's always something to do. Explore, build, conquer, and survive. The further you travel the more challenging adventures await.

Install Valheim on Linode with the Valheim Game Server Marketplace App to maximize your gaming experience.
