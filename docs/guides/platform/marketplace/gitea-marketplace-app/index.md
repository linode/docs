[Gitea](https://gitea.io/) is a community managed, painless, self-hosted Git service. Gitea is a complete solution for all aspects of your software development. At its core, Gitea serves as your centralized remote Git repository. Gitea also features built-in tools that represent every task in your development workflow, from planning to testing to releasing.

Self-hosting your software development with the Gitea Marketplace App offers total control of your codebase. At the same time, its familiar interface eases collaboration for you and your team. Gitea is one of the most popular self-hosted Git repository platforms, allowing you to benefit from a robust set of integrated tools and an active community.

## Deploying the Gitea Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

**Software installation should complete within 3-7 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

### Gitea Options

Here are the additional options available for this Marketplace App:

| Field | Description |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MySQL root Password** | The root password for your MySQL database. *Required*. |
| **Gitea Database Password** | The password for your Gitea database user. *Required*. |
| **The limited sudo user to be created for the Linode** | The Linux username created for this Linode with sudo permissions. |
| **The password for the limited sudo user** | The password for your limited sudo user. |
| **SSH Public Key** | The public key for SSH access with your limited sudo user. For more information, see [SSH add keys](/docs/guides/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/). |
| **Enable passwordless sudo access for the limited user?** | Select **Yes** to [disable SSH password authentication](/docs/guides/securing-your-server/#ssh-daemon-options) for your limited sudo user as an additional security measure. Requires an **SSH Public Key** for SSH access to your Linode. |
| **Disable root access over SSH?** | Select **Yes** to [disallow root logins over SSH](/docs/guides/securing-your-server/#ssh-daemon-options) as an additional security measure. Requires a configuration of a **limited sudo user** for SSH access to your Linode. |
| **Configure automatic security updates?** | Select **Yes** to enable [automatic security updates](/docs/guides/securing-your-server/#automatic-security-updates) for your Linode. |
| **Use fail2ban to prevent automated instrusion attempts?** | Select **Yes** to enable [SSH login protection with Fail2Ban](/docs/security/using-fail2ban-to-secure-your-server-a-tutorial/) as an additional security measure. |
| **Your Linode API Token** | Your Linode `API Token` is needed to create DNS records. If this is provided along with the `Subdomain` and `Domain` fields, the installation attempts to create DNS records via the Linode API. If you don't have a token, but you want the installation to create DNS records, you must [create a token](/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token) to use in this field before continuing. |
| **Subdomain** | The subdomain you wish the installer to create a DNS record for during setup, for example `www`. Requires a `Domain` and `API Token`. If no subdomain is specified, a DNS record is created for the root domain. |
| **Domain** | The domain name where you wish to host your Gitea server, for example `example.com`. Requires an `API Token`. For more guidance on using domains with Linode, see our [DNS Manager Guide](/docs/guides/dns-manager/). |
| **SOA Email for your domain** | The email address to register as your Start of Authority (SOA). This field is required for creating DNS records for a new domain. |
| **Do you need an MX record for this domain?** | Select **Yes** to automatically configure an [MX record](/docs/guides/dns-records-an-introduction/#mx) for the purpose of sending emails from your Linode. Additional configuration with Gitea is required after installation to enable sending emails with this app.|
| **Do you need an SPF record for this domain?** | Select **Yes** to automatically configure an [SPF record](/docs/guides/dns-records-an-introduction/#spf) for the purpose of sending emails from your Linode. Additional configuration with Gitea is required after installation to enable sending emails with this app. |
| **Would you like to use a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for your fully qualified domain name?** | Select **Yes** to configure an SSL Certificate for HTTPS access to your Gitea remote desktop. Requires a `Domain` and `Admin Email`. |
| **Admin Email for Let's Encrypt certificate** | The email address to register with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) when generating an SSL certificate for your fully qualified domain name. This field is required for HTTPS access to your Gitea remote desktop. |

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access your Gitea Site

After Gitea has finished installing, you can access your Gitea site using a web browser to complete setup and begin using your app.

1.  Enter your Linode's fully qualified domain name (for example, `https://www.example.com`) or [IPv4 address](/docs/guides/find-your-linodes-ip-address/) (for example, `http://192.0.2.0`) into a browser window to access the Gitea welcome page. Select the **Register** link to reach the initial configuration screen.

1.  Enter your [Gitea Database Password](#gitea-options) in the **Password** field.

    ![Gitea initial configuration settings.](initial-configuration-password.png 'Gitea initial configuration settings')

1.  Replace `localhost` with your Linode's fully qualified domain name or IPv4 address under **SSH Server Domain** and **Gitea Base URL** fields. Specify `https` in the **Gitea Base URL** field if you configured an SSL certificate for your domain.
