The OpenLiteSpeed Django app automatically installs Linux, the performance web server OpenLiteSpeed, Python LSAPI, and CertBot. OpenLiteSpeed Django features HTTP/3 support and easy setup for SSL and RewriteRules. It’s flexible enough to host multiple Django apps and supports many other apps including Node.js, Ruby, and CMS software like WordPress.

## Deploying the OpenLiteSpeed Django Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

**Software installation should complete within 10-15 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Getting Started > Create a Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/#create-a-linode). That said, some options may be limited or recommended based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the OpenLiteSpeed Django App

1.  Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH. See [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH
](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) for assistance. You should see output similar to the following:

    ![OpenLiteSpeed Django setup information](setupinfo-django.png)

1. You are then prompted to enter the domain you'd like to use for this instance. You can optionally use a custom domain provided you've already configured the *A Records* to point to this server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Otherwise, you can skip this by pressing *CTRL+C* which will use the IP address or default RDNS of the Compute Instance.

    {{< note >}}
For more documentation on how to assign a domain to your Linode, please review the [DNS Manager](/docs/guides/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on setting up your DNS records in the Cloud Manager, and read through [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/guides/dns-records-an-introduction/) for general information about how DNS works.

Now that you’ve accessed your OpenLiteSpeed Django instance, check out [the official OpenLiteSpeed Django documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/cloud/images/django/) to learn how to further configure your OpenLiteSpeed Django instance.
