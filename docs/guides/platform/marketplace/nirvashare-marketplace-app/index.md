NirvaShare is a simplified and secure enterprise file sharing solution built on top of your existing file storage. Use NirvaShare with SFTP, local storage, or even S3-compatible storage like Linode's [Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/). Collaborate with your internal or external users such as customers, partners, and vendors. NirvaShare provides fine-tuned access control in a very simplified manner. NirvaShare integrates with multiple many external identity providers such as Active Directory, GSuite, AWS SSO, KeyClock, and others.

## Getting Started after Deployment

After NirvaShare has finished installing, you can access your NirvaShare instance by visiting your [Linode's IP address](/docs/quick-answers/linode-platform/find-your-linodes-ip-address/) at port 8080. (for example, `http://192.0.2.0:8080`)

Once you visit the NirvaShare IP address you will be prompted with a Login page, you can enter `admin` as the *username* and `admin` as the *password*.
