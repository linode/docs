Pritunl is an open source VPN server and management panel. It gives the user the power of the OpenVPN protocol while using an intuitive web interface.

## Deploying the Pritunl Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

**Software installation should complete within 2-5 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

### Pritunl Options

Here are the additional options available for this Marketplace App:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **The limited sudo user to be created for the Linode** | This is the limited user account to be created for the Linode. This account has sudo user privileges. |
| **The password for the limited sudo user** | Set a password for the limited sudo user. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. This password can be used to perform any action on your server, similar to root, so make it long, complex, and unique. |
| **The SSH Public Key that will be used to access the Linode** | If you wish to access [SSH via Public Key](/docs/security/authentication/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) (recommended) rather than by password, enter the public key here. |
| **Disable root access over SSH?** | Select `Yes` to block the root account from logging into the server via SSH. Select `No` to allow the root account to login via SSH. |
| **Your Linode API Token** | Your Linode `API Token` is needed to create DNS records. If this is provided along with the `subdomain` and `domain` fields, the installation attempts to create DNS records via the Linode API. If you don't have a token, but you want the installation to create DNS records, you must [create one](/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token) before continuing. |
| **Subdomain** | The subdomain you wish the installer to create a DNS record for during setup. The suggestion given is `www`. The subdomain should only be provided if you also provide a `domain` and `API Token`. |
| **Domain** | The domain name where you wish to host your Pritunl instance. The installer creates a DNS record for this domain during setup if you provide this field along with your `API Token`. |
| **Admin Email for the server** | The start of authority (SOA) email address for this server. This email address will be added to the SOA record for the domain. This is a required field if you want the installer to create DNS records. |

### General Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Getting Started > Create a Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/#create-a-linode). That said, some options may be limited or recommended based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Debian 10
- **Recommended plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Pritunl App

1.  Log in to your Compute Instance over SSH. See [Connecting to a Remote Server Over SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) for assistance.

1.  Run the command below to obtain your setup key. This key is used in a later step.

        sudo pritunl setup-key

1.  Run the command below to generate the password:

        sudo pritunl default-password

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the domain you created in the beginning of your deployment. If you did not enter a custom domain, use the IP address of the server. You may need to access the self-signed certificate before continuing.

    {{< note >}}
    In Chrome, you can accept the self-signed certificate by clicking on Advanced and then click Proceed to <ip> (unsafe). In Firefox, click on Advanced, then Add Exception, and then Confirm Security Exception.

1.  The Pritunl Database Setup screen appears. Enter the setup key that was generated in a previous step.

1.  The login prompt appears. Enter `pritunl` as the username and then use the password generated in a previous step.

1.  Once you're logged in, you can change the default password and enter the domain information so Pritunl can setup the SSL certificates automatically:
