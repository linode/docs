A LEMP (Linux, [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/)) stack is a popular, free, and open-source web software bundle used for hosting websites on the Linux operating system. While similar to a [LAMP Stack](/docs/guides/deploy-lamp-stack-with-marketplace-apps/), a LEMP stack uses the NGINX web server as opposed to [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/). NGINX may be a preference for many reasons, however many will choose it due to it's speed and ability to perform under high load.

## Deploying the LEMP Stack Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide" >}}

**Software installation should complete within 2-3 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

### LEMP Stack Options

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **New User** | The username for a new non-root sudo user. *Required*.|
| **New User Password** | The Password for the new user. *Required*.|
| **MySQL Root Password** | The root password for your LEMP stack's MySQL database. This is not the same as your Linode's root password. *Required*. |

### General Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Getting Started > Create a Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/#create-a-linode). That said, some options may be limited or recommended based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** Debian 9
- **Recommended plan:** The Linode plan you deploy your LEMP stack on should account for the estimated workload. If you are standing up a simple web page, you can use a 1GB Linode (Nanode) or 2GB Linode. If you are standing up a larger or more robust web app, then consider a plan with higher RAM and CPU allocations.

## Getting Started After Deployment

After your LEMP stack has finished deploying, you can:

1. [Connect to your Linode via SSH](/docs/guides/getting-started/#connect-to-your-linode-via-ssh) as your root or limited user. You will need your Linode's root and/or user password to proceed. Note that your Linode's web root will be located in the `/var/www/html` directory.

1. [Navigate to the public IP address](/docs/guides/getting-started/#find-your-linode-s-ip-address) of your Linode in a browser. You will see the PHP settings that are active for your Linode.

1. Consult the following guides to learn more about working with the various components of the LEMP stack:

    - [Secure HTTP Traffic with Certbot](/docs/guides/secure-http-traffic-certbot/)
    - [How to Configure NGINX](/docs/guides/how-to-configure-nginx/)
    - [How to Optimize MySQL Performance Using MySQLTuner](/docs/guides/how-to-optimize-mysql-performance-using-mysqltuner/)

1.   Upload files to your web root directory with an SFTP application like [FileZilla](/docs/guides/filezilla/). Use the same root credentials that you would use for SSH.

1.   Assign a domain name to your Linode's IP address. Review the [DNS Manager](/docs/guides/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on setting up your DNS records in the Cloud Manager, and read through [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/guides/dns-records-an-introduction/) for general information about how DNS works.

## Software Included

The LEMP Stack Marketplace App will install the following software on your Linode:

| **Software** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| [**NGINX**](https://www.nginx.com/) | Web server that can be used to serve your site or web application.|
| [**MySQL Server**](https://www.mysql.com) | Relational database. |
| [**PHP 7**](https://www.php.net) | General purpose programming language. |
| [**UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall) | Firewall utility. Ports 22/tcp and 80/tcp for IPv4 and IPv6 will allow outgoing and incoming traffic. |
