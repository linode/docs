[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a database engine that provides access to non-relational, document-oriented databases. It is part of the growing [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) movement, along with databases like Redis and Cassandra (although there are vast differences among the many non-relational databases).

MongoDB seeks to provide an alternative to traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). In addition to its schema-free design and scalable architecture, MongoDB provides a JSON output and specialized, language-specific bindings that make it particularly attractive for use in custom application development and rapid prototyping. MongoDB has been used in a number of large scale [production deployments](https://www.mongodb.com/community/deployments) and is currently one of the most popular database engines across all systems.

## Deploying the MongoDB Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

**Software installation should complete within 2-5 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

### MongoDB Options

Here are the additional options available for this Marketplace App:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **MongoDB admin user password** | The Mongo admin user password. *Required*. |
| **MongoDB Version** | Select the verison of MongoDB you'd like to install.  |
| **Admin Email for the server** | The start of authority (SOA) email address for this server. This email address will be added to the SOA record for the domain. This is a required field if you want the installer to create DNS records. |
| **Your Linode API Token** | Your Linode `API Token` is needed to create DNS records. If this is provided along with the `subdomain` and `domain` fields, the installation attempts to create DNS records via the Linode API. If you don't have a token, but you want the installation to create DNS records, you must [create one](/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token) before continuing. |
| **Subdomain** | The subdomain you wish the installer to create a DNS record for during setup. The suggestion given is `www`. The subdomain should only be provided if you also provide a `domain` and `API Token`. |
| **Domain** | The domain name where you wish to access your application. The installer creates a DNS record for this domain during setup if you provide this field along with your `API Token`. |
| **The limited sudo user to be created for the Linode** | This is the limited user account to be created for the Linode. This account has sudo user privileges. |
| **The password for the limited sudo user** | Set a password for the limited sudo user. The password must meet the complexity strength validation requirements for a strong password. This password can be used to perform any action on your server, similar to root, so make it long, complex, and unique. |
| **The SSH Public Key that will be used to access the Linode** | If you wish to access [SSH via Public Key](/docs/security/authentication/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) (recommended) rather than by password, enter the public key here. |
| **Disable root access over SSH?** | Select `Yes` to block the root account from logging into the server via SSH. Select `No` to allow the root account to login via SSH. |

### General Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/guides/creating-a-compute-instance/). Some options may be limited or have recommended values based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** Debian 11, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used, though consider using a [High Memory Compute Instance](https://www.linode.com/products/high-memory/) for larger databases in a production environment.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Access the MongoDB Shell

After MongoDB has finished deploying, you can access and administer it directly from the console.

1.  Log in to your Compute Instance via [SSH](/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/) or [Lish](/docs/guides/using-the-lish-console/).

1.  Launch the [mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.4/mongo/) by running the following command. When prompted, enter the admin user password you set when creating this instance.

        mongo -u admin -p --authenticationDatabase admin

    The `-u`, `-p`, and `--authenticationDatabase` options in the above command are required in order to authenticate connections to the shell. Without authentication, the MongoDB shell can be accessed but will not allow connections to databases.

    The `admin` user is purely administrative based on the roles specified. It is defined as an administrator of users for all databases, but does not have any database permissions itself. You may use it to create additional users and define their roles. If you are using multiple applications with MongoDB, set up different users with custom permissions for their corresponding databases.

### Create a User Table

1.  As the `admin` user, create a new database to store regular user data for authentication. The following example calls this database `user-data`:

        use user-data

1.  Permissions for different databases are handled in separate `roles` objects. This example creates the user, `example-user`, with read-only permissions for the `user-data` database and has read and write permissions for the `exampleDB` database that we'll create in the [Manage Data and Collections](#manage-data-and-collections) section below.

    Create a new, non-administrative user to enter test data. Change both `example-user` and `password` to something relevant and secure:

        db.createUser({user: "example-user", pwd: "password", roles:[{role: "read", db: "user-data"}, {role:"readWrite", db: "exampleDB"}]})

    To create additional users, repeat this step as the administrative user, creating new usernames, passwords and roles by substituting the appropriate values.

1.  Exit the mongo shell:

        quit()

For more information on access control and user management, as well as other tips on securing your databases, refer to the [MongoDB Security Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/security).
