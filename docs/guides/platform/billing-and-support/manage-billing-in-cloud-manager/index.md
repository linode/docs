We've done our best to create straightforward billing and payment policies. Still have questions? Use this guide to learn how to make payments, update your billing information, and remove services. To learn how billing works see the [How Linode Billing Works](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/how-linode-billing-works/) guide. If you have a question that isn't answered in either guide, please feel free to [contact Support](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/support/).

## Viewing Current Balance

To view your current balance, follow the steps below. This shows you the sum of all Linode services used so far in the month, down to the hour.

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select **Account** from the sidebar links.
1.  The Billing Info page shows you a billing summary at the top of the screen.

    [![This customer has a $9.00 uninvoiced balance and $24.00 due](billing-amount-due-and-uninvoiced-balance.png "This customer has a $31.52 uninvoiced balance and $0 due")](billing-amount-due-and-uninvoiced-balance.png)

    Here, you can keep track of your outstanding balance.

    -  **Account Balance** is the current invoiced balance. This is how much you currently owe. If you have credit on your account, you instead see that credit. In the example above, the customer owes $24.00.
    -  **Accrued Charges** is the accrued balance that has not yet been invoiced for the month. In the example above, the customer has accrued a $9.00 balance for Linode services this month so far, but has not been invoiced yet for those services. You can check this as frequently or infrequently as you wish. It gets updated every hour as you use and add Linode services.

### Promotional Credit

If you have a promotional credit active on your account, the credit appears on the Billing Info page. In the below example, the user has a $100 credit applied to their account. If the promo code has an expiration date, the expiration date is also displayed.

## Making a Payment

You can use the Cloud Manager to pay an outstanding balance or prepay for Linode services. Here's how:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select **Account** from the sidebar links.
1.  In the billing summary at the top, click the **Make a Payment** link.
1.  The **Make a Payment** panel opens.

    [![The Make a Payment Panel](billing-make-a-payment-panel.png "The Make a Payment Panel.")](billing-make-a-payment-panel.png)

1.  Enter the amount of money you would like to pay in the **Payment Amount** field.
1.  Enter the CVV number on the back of your credit card in the **CVV** field.
1.  Click **Pay Now**.

The payment may take a few minutes to be applied to your account.

## Updating Credit Card Information

Keep your credit card information up to date to prevent service interruptions. Here's how:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select **Account** from the sidebar links.
1.  In the Payment Method pane, click the **Edit** link.

    ![Click the Edit link in the Payment Method Pane](billing-edit-payment-method.png "Click the Edit link in the Payment Method Pane")

1.  The **Edit Credit Card** panel opens. Enter your credit card number, the card's expiration date, and the CVV. The address affiliated with the card must match the [Contact Information](/docs/guides/accounts-and-passwords/#updating-contact-information) active on your account.
1.  Click **Save**. Your credit card information is updated.

    {{< note >}}
If you have an outstanding balance, you need to make a manual payment to bring your account up to date. See the [Making a Payment](#making-a-payment) section for more information.

    {{< note >}}
A $1.00 authorization hold may be placed on your credit card by your banking institution when our payment processor tests the validity of the card. This is normal behavior and does not result in a charge on your card.

## Accessing Billing History

All of your billing history is stored in the Cloud Manager. Here's how to access it:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select **Account** from the sidebar links.
1.  A link to the last invoice is available at the top of the screen in the Billing Summary by clicking the **View Last Invoice** link.
1.  You can view your Billing & Payment History at the bottom of the Billing Info page. This list is filterable by transaction type and time.

    ![Billing and Payment History Table](billing-and-payment-history-table.png "Billing and Payment History Table")

1.  Click on any invoice to view the charges for a particular month. You can also click the **Download PDF** link next to any invoice to download a PDF of the invoice to your computer. <!-- You can also download invoices in PDF format. -->

## Removing Services

Our services are provided without a contract, so you're free to remove services from your account at any time. Here's how:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  To remove a Linode from your account, select **Linodes** from the sidebar links. Expand the **more options ellipsis** menu to the right of the Linode you would like to remove, then select **Delete**.
1.  To remove a NodeBalancer from your account, select **NodeBalancers** from the sidebar links. Select **Delete** for the NodeBalancer you would like to remove.
1.  To remove the Linode Backup Service, select **Linodes** from the sidebar links. Select the corresponding Linode. Under the **Backups** tab click the **Cancel Backups** button at the bottom of the page.

{{< caution >}}
Removing a Linode from your account makes its data irretrievable. This includes the backups of it that you have created through [our Backup Service](/docs/guides/linode-backup-service/), including Manual Snapshots.

If you would like to preserve your Linode's data before removing it from your account, you need to create an external backup. You may use the suggestions in our [Backing Up Your Data](/docs/guides/backing-up-your-data/) guide for some examples of how to do this.

When removing a Linode from your account that has been active for at least 24 hours, our systems automatically create a [Linode Image](/docs/guides/linode-images/) from the backup. You may use [this guide](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/17441/how-do-i-restore-a-deleted-linode) from [our Community Questions site](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/) to restore this backup.

There is a very small chance that Linode Support can restore your data outside of these circumstances. The sooner you reach out to Linode Support, the more likely this can occur. Please open [a Support ticket](https://cloud.linode.com/support/tickets) to explore this possibility.
