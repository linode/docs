We've done our best to create straightforward billing and payment policies. Still have questions? Use this guide to learn how to make payments, update your billing information, and remove services. To learn how billing works see the [How Linode Billing Works](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/how-linode-billing-works/) guide. If you have a question that isn't answered in either guide, please feel free to [contact Support](/docs/platform/billing-and-support/support/).

## Viewing Current Balance

To view your current balance, follow the steps below. This shows you the sum of all Linode services used so far in the month, down to the hour.

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select **Account** from the sidebar links.
1.  On the right side you will see your **Billing Information** panel.

    [![This customer has a $63.52 uninvoiced balance and $0 due](billing-amount-due-and-uninvoiced-balance.png "This customer has a $63.52 uninvoiced balance and $0 due")](billing-amount-due-and-uninvoiced-balance.png)

    **Amount Due** is the current invoiced balance and **Uninvoiced Balance** is the accrued balance that has not yet been invoiced for the month.

    Here, you can keep track of your outstanding balance. In the example above, the customer has accrued a $63.52 balance for Linode services this month so far, but it has not been invoiced yet. You can check this as frequently or infrequently as you wish. It gets updated every hour as you use and add Linode services.

## Making a Payment

You can use the Cloud Manager to pay an outstanding balance or prepay for Linode services. Here's how:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select **Account** from the sidebar links.
1.  Select **Account & Billing**.
1.  Expand the **Make a Payment** panel.

    [![The Make a Payment Panel](billing-make-a-payment-panel.png "The Make a Payment Panel.")](billing-make-a-payment-panel.png)

1.  Enter the amount of money you would like to pay in the **Amount to Charge** field.
1.  Enter the CVV number on the back of your credit card in the **CVV** field.
1.  Click **Confirm Payment**.

The payment may take a few minutes to be applied to your account.

## Updating Credit Card Information

Keep your credit card information up to date to prevent service interruptions. Here's how:

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](http://cloud.linode.com).
1.  Select **Account** from the sidebar links.
1.  Select **Account & Billing**.
1.  Expand the **Update Credit Card** box and enter your credit card number and the card's expiration date. The address affiliated with the card must match the [Contact Information](/docs/guides/accounts-and-passwords/#updating-contact-information) active on your account.
1.  Click **Save**. Your credit card information will be updated.

    {{< note >}}
If you have an outstanding balance, you will need to make a manual payment to bring your account up to date. See the [Making a Payment](#making-a-payment) section for more information.

A $1.00 authorization hold may be placed on your credit card by your banking institution when our payment processor tests the validity of the card. This is normal behavior and does not result in a charge on your card.
