Some countries, states, and regions require us by law to collect taxes. As such, customers located in these locations are charged the appropriate tax rate for any taxable services billed to their account. The taxes that Linode collects are listed on customer invoices (see the [Viewing Invoices and Payments](/docs/guides/manage-billing-in-cloud-manager/#viewing-invoices-and-payments) section of our Cloud Manager Billing guide).

{{< note >}}
Pricing and service fees posted publicly, such as our [Pricing](https://www.linode.com/pricing/) page and listed in the Cloud Manager, do not include taxes.

## Adding a Tax ID

If you are a registered business, you may provide Linode with a valid tax ID, such as a VAT identification number (*VAT ID*) or GST identification number (*GST ID*, also referred to as an *ABN* in Australia and a *GSTIN* in India). Customers outside of the United States will not be charged VAT or GST in subsequent invoices once their tax ID is verified. You might choose to do this if your business is tax exempt or if your business is liable to pay taxes directly due to a special tax status or program (like RCM - Reverse Charge Mechanism). Users within the United States will need to submit both their tax ID and a state tax exemption or reseller's certificate in a [Support Ticket](https://www.linode.com/support/) before becoming exempt.

{{< caution >}}
If you are located in one of the countries that require taxes on our services, you are still liable for those taxes. Adding your tax ID does not exempt you from your liability to pay any taxes that have been mandated by your country for our services.
{{</ caution >}}

To add (or update) your account with a tax ID, follow the instructions below. A tax ID can also be added to an account during the signup process.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

1. Navigate to the **Account** link in the sidebar.

1. Expand the **Update Contact Information** panel under the **Billing Info** tab.

1. Enter your tax ID in the **Tax ID** field.

1. Click on the **Save** button at the bottom of the **Update Contact Information** panel.

## FAQs

### How is my tax location determined?

Your tax location is determined by the contact information you provided during sign up or under the **Account** page in the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

### How can I change my tax location?

You may update your tax location by navigating to the **Account** page in the [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) and then expanding the **Update Contact Information** panel.

### My business is tax exempt. How can I stop further taxes from being charged to my Linode account?

If your business or organization is tax exempt, you should add a verifiable tax ID to your Linode account. Once verified, taxes will no longer be added to invoices for customers outside of the United States. See [Adding a Tax ID](#adding-a-tax-id). Customers inside the United States will additionally need to submit any tax exemption certificates or reseller's certificates by [Opening a Support Ticket](https://www.linode.com/support/) which contains the required information.

### How can I review the taxes charged on previous invoices?

To view previous invoices, see the [Viewing Invoices and Payments](/docs/guides/manage-billing-in-cloud-manager/#viewing-invoices-and-payments) section of our Cloud Manager Billing guide. Specifically, review the **Tax** column for taxes charged on each service.

### Why is my invoice in USD? Can I get an invoice in another currency?

To keep our pricing stable and consistent, rather than fluctuating with exchange rates, we do not bill in local currency. All invoices are in USD.
