{{< caution >}}
Object Storage is similar to a subscription service. **Once enabled, you will be billed at the flat rate regardless of whether or not there are active buckets on your account.** You must [Cancel Object Storage](/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/cancel/) to stop billing for this service.
