{{< content "images-beta-note-shortguide" >}}

Linode's **Images** service allows users to store custom disk images in the Cloud preconfigured with the exact software and settings required for certain applications and workloads. These Images can be quickly deployed to new or existing Linode, saving users time from manually setting up their entire system after each deployment.

## Pricing and Availability

Images are currently available at no charge to Linode customers and can be deployed across [all regions](https://www.linode.com/global-infrastructure/).

{{< note >}}
**Pricing change:** Images will transition to a paid service with a cost of $0.10/GB per month for each Custom Image stored on an account. This change will be communicated to customers in advance. Recovery Images, generated automatically after a Linode is deleted, are provided at no cost for a finite period of time.

- **[Uploading an Image](#uploading-an-image)**

## Managing Images

To take action on an Image, locate the Image within the **Images** page of the Cloud Manager and click the corresponding **ellipsis** options menu. From here, there are a few actions that can be initiated:

- **Edit:** Change the *Label* and *Description* for the Image.
- **[Deploy to a New Linode](#deploying-an-image-to-a-new-linode):** Create a new Linode using the Image.
- **[Deploy to an Existing Linode](#rebuilding-and-deploying-an-image-to-an-existing-linode):** Rebuild the Linode using the Image.
- **Delete:** Delete the Image (cannot be undone).
