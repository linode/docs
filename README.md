###### [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) | [Formatting Guide](https://linode.com/docs/linode-writers-formatting-guide/)

> Linode maintains a library of tutorials hosted at https://www.linode.com/docs/. The guides serve as an easy to follow reference for Linux, web servers, development, and more.

### Quickstart

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Download [Hugo v0.52](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.52). We recommend this older version as newer versions of Hugo moved away from the Black Friday Markdown processor in favor of Goldmark; this repository relies on Black Friday.

3. Navigate into the cloned repo and run `hugo server`.

4. On a web browser, navigate to `localhost:1313/docs/`.

## How can I write a guide?
