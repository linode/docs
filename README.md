# Update: 07/22/16

Linode's bounty program has been an overwhelming success. Too succesful, in fact! Our inbox and repository are overflowing with proposed articles.

As a four-man team responsible for both internally *and* externally sourced docs, we're in a bit over our collective head. That's why - until further notice - we're no longer accepting new submissions for the Linode bounty program. Any new guides submitted, whether through GitHub or email, after today will be rejected without review.

Rest assured, this is a temporary moratorium. Once we've cleared through the backlog and given the appropriate time and consideration (and, hopefully, payout) to the authors already patiently waiting, we'll resume the bounty program and with it, a revised set of topic requirements.

Please note, if you see the need for a correction in an existing guide, feel free to make a pull request. We still want to improve and update our existing guides, even as we review new ones.
